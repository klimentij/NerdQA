Today I am going to help you save time and hassle by giving you a concrete answer whether you should learn JavaScript before learning Node JS or not. You have learned about Node JS and would like to dive in to become a backend developer. Since you asked, this means you don’t know JS or have little experience with it. If you have taken another programming course before (like Python) then you have the proper programming foundation and can go ahead and start learning Node JS without taking a JavaScript course. You can pick up the fundamentals of JS while you build servers with Node. However, if this is the first time you are programming, then I would highly recommend you take a foundation web development course in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get your ABCs down. If you do decide to take a JS course, I want you to double down on these particular skills because these are frequently used in Node JS. It’s possible to learn each of these individual things while you are learning Node JS. For that case, I would suggest you get a rough idea by reading the list below and work accordingly. JavaScript is a functional programming language and the way the runtime works, it has the feature to have callbacks. If you already have the foundation covered, I suggest you take on a Node course and learn JavaScript as you go. On the other side, if JS is your first language or you are out of touch for many years, then go and brush up the concepts mentioned in this article. Even if you do go out and spend extra time learning the ropes of JavaScript, the time will be spent well because it’s a great language to keep on your arsenal.</td>
