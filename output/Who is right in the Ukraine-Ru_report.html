This disproportionate restriction of the right to freedom of expression had led to 443 convictions between March 2022 and November 2023, according to Ukrainian media, with many resulting in non-custodial sentences. An example of this offence was calling the war an “internal civil conflict”. An advocate of the right to conscientious objection, he was accused of “justifying Russian aggression against Ukraine”. His home was searched, and he was placed under a night curfew pending trial. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (which remained in disputed ecclesiastical subordination to the Russian Orthodox Church) was regularly accused by state authorities of remaining an agent for Russia in its war of aggression.</td>
