Introduction\nWhen and how did budgeting as we know it come to be? This may strike some readers as a somewhat\nidle question, but it turns out to be more interesting when one considers two facts about budgeting. First,\nthe very concept of budgeting whose origin is examined in this paper is somewhat unnatural, or not very\nlikely to have smoothly evolved as an extension of the ideas and institutions of the state that prevailed\nthrough most of human history. Second, virtually all countries in the world, not just, say, the OECD\nmembers, nevertheless currently subscribe to one same model of budgeting, in the sense that the\nframework for decision-making and the principles governing how that framework shall operate, are identical\nthe world over, at least ostensibly.1 Such uniformity is remarkable, even more so when one observes that\nthis was all achieved quite quickly and recently in historical time \u2013 for the majority of the world\u2019s countries\ntoday, budgeting is not even a century old; for the other, early-adapter group, barely two centuries. So,\nagain, we ask: how did this model of budgeting begin and spread to the world?\nSince the terms \u201cbudget\u201d or \u201cbudgeting\u201d are often used both in government affairs and even private everyday\nlife quite loosely, it will do to begin the discussion with a definition of what we mean by these words to avoid\nany ambiguity or, even worse, confusion. The specific definition of budgeting as discussed in this paper\nconsists of two parts: the framework defined to regulate the budgetary decision-making authorities, or powers;\nand the principles that guide the decision-making interactions within that framework. The framework of modern\nbudgeting, again in all countries today, stipulates that the budgetary decision cannot be made unilaterally.\nOnly the government, and not the legislature, has the budgetary initiative to propose the budget. On its own,\nhowever, the government may not finalise the decision,2 which is the legislature\u2019s exclusive right, commonly\ncalled the power of the purse. In short, within itself the budgetary decision framework replicates separation of\npowers, the core principle of democracy. Turning to the principles of budgeting, these refer to the well-known\nrequirements of annuality, unity, universality, and specificity (as to the purpose of each item of expenditure),\nwhose ultimate purpose is to safeguard checks and balances between the two entities, i.e. to ensure that\nseparation of powers is not undermined in favour of either side.3\nRecalling that human societies and states had existed as monarchies for thousands of years4 until the last\ncentury or two, the very idea of budgeting as defined in the previous paragraph would have constituted a\ndirect challenge to the monarch. Simplistically described,5the monarch was the sovereign who held sole,\nundivided power over his kingdom; an attempt to limit his power would be taken as a challenge to monarchy\nor the state itself. As far as the kingdom\u2019s finances went, this could have been described by such alternative\nnames as the king\u2019s, state\u2019s, governmental, or even public finance, operating on the basis of the monarch\u2019s\nsole authority, but there would have been no budgeting as yet. Indeed, advocating our notion of budgeting\ncould have amounted to sedition or perhaps even an act of treason. On a more practical note, how could\nan official entity be acknowledged to exist with the authority to stand up to the king, an apparent self\u0002contradiction to the simplistic definition of the monarch? That had to wait for Hobbes, Locke, and\nMontesquieu to expound on their theories of the state and how its power could be regulated. This suggests\nthat the birth of budgeting could not have been an easy or natural evolution. Its inception and subsequent\npropagation are likely to have resulted from, or even formed an integral part of, radical changes in\nstatehood and government, both conceptually and in reality.\nIn the following, we recount the history of budgeting, beginning with its inception in early 13th century\nEngland in the meadow of Runnymede. The Magna Carta not only had the crucial written agreement from\nthe monarch that his authority could be checked, but also included a clause limiting his powers to tax \u2013\nbecause taxes at the time were invariably very-short-term special occasions for specific purposes (usually\nfinancing a war), this by extension meant that his spending could be questioned, too. Subsequent events\nin the following centuries, especially during Charles the First\u2019s reign and the Glorious Revolution in the 17th\ncentury, gave us almost all the main features of the budget system as we know it today. The paper then\nreviews how this first budget system invented by the English subsequently propagated itself to all countries\nworldwide during the 19th and 20th centuries.\n\uf07c 3\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\n1.2. The Beginning: England\nThe origin of the budget system remains somewhat obscure, usually summarised by writers in a few pages\nthat list some events in English history leading up to, during, and following the Civil War, Interregnum,\nRestoration, and Glorious Revolution, all in the 17th century. These descriptions often come with the added\nobservation that already by then some key practices or institutions6 were long-established traditions rooted\nin the \u201cmists of history,\u201d which really does not add much to a better understanding of how things began.\nTwo observations may help to explain why the evolution of budgeting remains not so clear. First, the events\nof significance in the development of budgeting occurred haphazardly over long stretches of time, even\ncenturies. It was difficult to be aware of, much less keep track of, any developments in budgeting since it\nhad not yet coalesced into anything meriting recognition as a \u201csystem\u201d worthy of attention. Moreover,\nprogress was not necessarily steady or monotonic, but saw frequent relapses or outright nullifications. It\ndid not help, either, that the budget system was initially hardly a priority item by itself on any agenda but\nwas usually driven along as a sidebar by some other larger event. In short, the budget system more or less\nhappened as an accidental accretion of the spoils dropped off by other historical events,7 and definitely\nnot a result of deliberate design as the tightly interlocking elements of the modern budget system may\nsuggest.\nSecond, the origin of budgeting may not have been prominently visible because it involves three large\ntransitions in how key concepts and institutions are understood. These transitions entailed significant shifts\nin thinking or perspective, so that the contemporary descriptions of distant beginning points may look or\nsound different from what modern budgeting would have us look for. Rather than just search for something\ncomparable to budgeting as known today, one may need to go deeper and clarify what are the significant\nfeatures and principles of budgeting and look for events that precipitated their development. There are\nthree such crucial transitions that eventually led to the birth of the budget system as we know it.\nThe first concerns how the notion of sovereignty has changed from the once prevalent idea of a divine or\nabsolute right to rule unopposed. In contrast, the prevailing practice today is to install an entity that can\nstand up to the monarch or leader. For example, Parliament happened, with powers that are different from,\nyet capable of opposing the Crown. Seemingly this is a topic that belongs exclusively to political thought\nor systems. Yet a moment\u2019s reflection should reveal that in fact, separation of powers forms the absolute\nprerequisite principle for the modern budget system to be. Indeed, in every single country in the world\ntoday,8the modern budgeting framework itself embodies this principle \u2013 neither government nor the\nlegislature may make the budgeting decision unilaterally. The government has the budget initiative that\ngives it the exclusive right to propose the budget, but not the final decision; the legislature, while usually\ndenied the right to write in spending items to its own liking, has the power of the purse, or the right to render\nthe final decision on the government\u2019s proposal. Without this important principle, budgeting as known to\neveryone today would lose its very reason to exist, leaving public finances to be managed by different state\ninstitutions in some other manner, possibly by unilateral decision left in the hands of one person or a single\nentity of the state. As such a connection between budgeting decisions and the state\u2019s political framework\nmay not be very obvious, this may explain why few writers have explicitly pointed to the Magna Carta as\none of the originating points of modern budgeting.\nThe second transition concerns the focus of national finances. At the beginning, almost all attention fell on\nregulating revenues, or what the king could take from his people \u2013 it was not focused on spending, which\nis the domain of interest for modern budgeting. As a corollary, because all attention focused on the size of\nthe burden being imposed on the people, any thought given to spending would centre mostly on the total\namount, with less scrutiny applied to the specifics making up that total. As attested to by Willoughby,\nWilloughby and Lindsay (1917, pp. 26-27[1]), even in England, the inventor and forerunner of modern\nbudgeting, \u201cthough the idea of supreme control over the public purse by the House of Commons was early\nestablished [\u2026] no means for making this control really effective were put into execution until well into the\n4 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nnineteenth century. [\u2026] Control at this time meant a control over revenues and receipts rather than the\nexpenditures of government.\u201d Yet even in the early days, Parliament in its deliberations was not totally\nunaware or uninterested in the purpose of spending, and to some extent, whether the amount and purpose\ncould be justified. But for one looking for an early instance of Parliament focusing on control over spending,\nthere would be a tendency to miss the early interventions by Parliament in the Crown\u2019s expenditures\nbecause they are couched more in terms of revenues. Again, this would have been further obscured by\ndistractions from the political and social events underlying the budgeting issues at hand.\nThe third point concerns the scope of the budget, or what we refer to in modern terms as unity and\nuniversality. In medieval times, only a small part of the king\u2019s spending involved budgeting, or approval by\nParliament. Perhaps one searching for budgeting\u2019s origins would have been well aware and taken into\naccount that there would have been nothing in the beginning stages like the full-blown extensive budget of\nmodern times. But the problem may have been compounded by the fact that these early budgetary\ncontests-of-wills were masked in terms, again, of taxes, rather than expenditures. Moreover, as a further\ndistraction, e.g. what was at stake for Parliament in 1626 was not really the funds requested by Charles I,\nbut a purely political cause. The dismissal of the controversial Duke of Buckingham was for Parliament the\ntrue objective behind the tactic of withholding the \u201csupplies\u201d requested by the King. It was only much later,\neven later than all the tumultuous events that transpired up to the Glorious Revolution of 1688, that\nParliament steadily broadened the scope of its control over the use of the King\u2019s incomes from other\nsources. It took a further century for this to culminate in something that finally resembled a modern budget\nwhen the Consolidated Fund was established in 1787 as \u201cone fund into which shall flow every stream of\npublic revenue [\u2026].\u201d9 The fact that the nascent stages of budgeting involved so little of the king\u2019s spending\nmeans that the size, composition, and scope of the early budgets would not have matched well with the\nmodern budget. This would again have made it easier to overlook some of the early developments.\n1.2.1. Limiting the Crown\u2019s authority: Magna Carta Libertatum\nAlong with many institutions the English have given to the world, the story of budgeting also begins with\nthe Magna Carta Libertatum, or the Great Charter of Liberties, sealed and issued by King John in June\n1215. 10 However, the Charter is not very often mentioned in relation to budgeting. When it is cited, it is\nusually to highlight the fact that it contained the first written legal instance11 of the principle of taxation by\nconsent:12\nClause 12: No scutage nor aid may be levied in our kingdom without its general consent, [...]\nClause 14: To obtain the general consent of the realm for the assessment of an aid [\u2026] or a scutage, we will\ncause the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons to be summoned individually by letter. [\u2026]\nAs taxation concerns the other side of national finances than budgeting, neither Maitland nor Willoughby\net al. refers to the Charter directly in the recounting of budgeting\u2019s inception. Yet they are still quick to point\nout that taxes at the time were mostly temporary and of special purpose in nature, seldom lasting more\nthan a year. The most common such purpose was to finance a war or some military venture, which could\nnot be covered by the king\u2019s own usual income.13\nAlthough the Magna Carta restricted the monarch\u2019s rights regarding revenues, mandating that the monarch\nmust obtain the consent of parliament on taxation, in doing so it enabled Parliament to gain and gradually\nstrengthen its power to intervene as well in the Crown\u2019s expenditures. This was because most taxes at the\ntime were special taxes designated to be spent on specific short-term purposes. Under the feudal system,\nthe monarch was also the leading feudal lord with the largest fief and the greatest wealth, which generated\nrevenues that usually sufficed for the routine expenditures of the Crown. Therefore, when a monarch\nrequested the consent of parliament on taxation, the additional funds were mostly sought to finance wars\nor other emergencies that required special funding beyond what the monarch\u2019s own income could meet.14\n\uf07c 5\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nThus, the newly confirmed15 parliamentary power to intervene in taxation through its right of approval also\ngave parliament the means, if not the implicit right, to question the monarch\u2019s reasons for requesting the\nnew tax. Parliament now found itself in a position to able to question whether the monarch\u2019s intended\nexpenditures out of the tax revenues was justifiable. Accordingly, even though the matter was phrased\nexclusively in terms of taxes, or revenue, from the beginning these provisions in the Charter comprised,\nhowever indirectly, parliamentary intervention in the king\u2019s spending. This right to intervene would belong\nat first to the barons, and shortly thereafter to Parliament, founded some 50 years later when Simon de\nMontfort called his second Parliament. This is often referred to as the first representative English parliament\nbecause it also included both the knights and the burgesses, who later became the Commons. Following\nthis interpretation, one may argue that the Charter\u2019s restriction on the king\u2019s finances makes the Charter\nthe originating event of the modern budget system.\nHowever, even if the Charter had not included any provision on national finances (whether on taxes or\nspending), a strong case can still be made for recognising it as an important starting point for budgeting,\npurely in respect to the regulation of power without any reference to finances. The budget system could\nstill have been adopted later in that case, provided it is recognised that there can exist an entity or institution\nthat can legally or safely challenge the monarch\u2019s wishes. But the budget system could not have been built\nor sustained without the Charter having firmly established the notion that there is another power that can\nconfront the king and enforce the terms he has agreed to, by means of physical force if necessary, as\nspecified in clause 61 of the Charter:\nClause 61: [\u2026]\nIf we, our chief justice, our officials, or any of our servants offend in any respect against any man, or transgress\nany of the articles of the peace or of this security, and the offence is made known to four of the said twenty\u0002five barons, they shall come to us \u2013 or in our absence from the kingdom to the chief justice \u2013 to declare it and\nclaim immediate redress. If we, or in our absence abroad the chief justice, make no redress within forty days,\nreckoning from the day on which the offence was declared to us or to him, the four barons shall refer the matter\nto the rest of the twenty-five barons, who may distrain upon and assail us in every way possible, with the\nsupport of the whole community of the land, by seizing our castles, lands, possessions, or anything\nelse saving only our own person and those of the queen and our children, until they have secured such redress\nas they have determined upon. Having secured the redress, they may then resume their normal obedience to\nus.\n[\u2026]\nIn other words, the principle that the king is not above the law but is subject to it is an absolute prerequisite\nfor a budget system devised to preclude unilateral spending decisions. That the Charter did in fact not\nforget to have a provision to circumscribe the king\u2019s authority on taxes, or more generally on national\nfinances, only reaffirms the fact that the ruler\u2019s or the government\u2019s finances is a crucial element of state\npower.16 But even had the Charter omitted any sort of financial provision, its explicit affirmation that the\nking\u2019s power is not absolute, but subject to the law and ultimately limited by the will of some other entity,\nis logically and legally the essential sine qua non on which the modern budget system is founded.\nThe Charter\u2019s real significance is that it settled the debate between rival and mutually incompatible\nconcepts of sovereignty or the locus of state power. These were: the notion that the king\u2019s authority derives\nfrom God and therefore he is not answerable to the people; the other concept that the king was not above\nthe law, which was, ultimately, God\u2019s law. Additionally, in a similar vein to the second concept, there was\nalso the pre-Norman tradition of electing kings, whose authority would naturally be much more limited than\nan absolute monarch. The king so elected would require the counsel and consent in important matters\nfrom the people or at least the nobles, or the witan, who formed the witenagemot in Anglo-Saxon England,\nor, in the other Germanic cultures, the Thing (\u00feing).17 These were all ideas of sovereignty that were still\nrather vague and not very clearly thought out yet. Despite the Magna Carta seemingly having settled the\nquestion, history shows the competing ideas each lived on, to be resolved decisively only centuries later\n6 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nin quite violent fashion in England and France, ending only with beheading the monarch himself, Charles I\nand Louis XVI, respectively. King John himself, in the short time before he met a rather undignified end\nthe following year in 1216, repudiated the Charter that had been proclaimed in his name with his own seal.\nFurthermore, the Charter, undergoing minor revisions at each turn, had to be reconfirmed with each new\nking.18 Despite the continual need to have it reaffirmed, having a clearly written and signed document was\na powerful precedent that buttressed Parliament\u2019s position in its disputes with the king. For example, the\nproceedings of the 1626 Parliament, 19 which clarified and solidified the concept of appropriations as\nunderstood today, record that the famed jurist Sir Edward Coke repeatedly appealed to \u2018ancient traditions\u2019\nbut also invoked the Magna Carta as the legal basis for Parliament\u2019s right to withhold agreement to the\nrequest for \u201csupplies\u201d by Charles I. It may be of interest to note that each time Sir Coke refers to the\nCharter, he emphasises that it has been reaffirmed \u201cabove thirty times\u201d to that date (over some four\ncenturies and by at least seventeen monarchs).\nAs Sir Coke\u2019s remarks remind us, well before the formation of a theoretical or conceptual argument to\nsubject the monarch\u2019s powers to the rule of law, it would have been important to have established in\npractice, too, that the monarch ought not be able to dismiss such notions lightly.20 This is where Edward I\nis noted to have set an early precedent for the Charter\u2019s reaffirmation, and to have firmed up a common\nunderstanding that laws be enacted by Parliament rather than by the monarch\u2019s ordinances. The UK\nParliament\u2019s website succinctly summarises the significance of his rule in this regard (UK Parliament,\nn.d.[2]):\n\u201c[\u2026] over the course of his reign (1272-1307) he summoned [Parliament] on 46 occasions. For the first 20\nyears of his reign it met regularly \u2013 almost twice a year. [\u2026] They were called on primarily to listen to and\napprove the King\u2019s plan for a new tax. Over the following years it became an accepted rule that the\nrepresentatives of those who were going to be most affected by taxation had to give their consent to it in\nParliament.\u201d\nIn 1297, Edward attempted to tax the clergy by ordinance without the assent of Parliament, setting off a\ncrisis that was soon resolved when he reversed his position and agreed to the Confirmation of the Charters\n(Yale Law School, 2008[3]). Article 1 reaffirms the Charter; Article 6, more specifically, the need to obtain\nthe consent of the realm for taxes: 21\n\u201cArticle 1. [\u2026] Know ye that [\u2026] the Great Charter of Liberties [\u2026] shall be kept in every point without breach.\n[\u2026]\nArticle 6. for no business from henceforth will we take such manner of aids, mises, nor prises from our realm,\nbut by the common assent of all the realm, and for the common profit thereof, saving the ancient aids and\nprises due and accustomed.\u201d\nEvolution of political thought\nThe frequent need to reaffirm the Charter\u2019s principles over the centuries, practically with each monarch,\nindicates that the principles were alive and well throughout that period in the practice or reality of national\npolitics. But it also points to a continued absence of a solid theoretical basis showing a model in which the\nmonarch\u2019s authority could be limited. The monarch had been simplistically defined in practically most\ncultures throughout history as the supreme, sole authority over a state, but the principles underlying the\nCharter would have this authority subjected to checks by other entities within the kingdom \u2013 clearly a self\u0002contradiction, but also an absolute requisite for the very idea of budgeting to exist. Jumping ahead\ntemporarily of our otherwise chronological narration, it took the horrors of the English Civil War for political\nthought to finally come up with a well-reasoned model that resolved this contradiction.\nFirst, the notion that what would later be called a social contract can be deducted from reason, where the\nstate necessarily needs a ruler with supreme power, can be traced back to Hobbes (1651[4]) and his\n\uf07c 7\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nmetaphor for this ruler, Leviathan. In the evolution of political thought, in having \u201creason\u201d make the first\nsolid progress in taming \u201cmight makes right,\u201d Hobbes\u2019 contribution was to effectively sever the need for\nany theological justification of the sovereign, rendering the latter\u2019s absolute rights somewhat less absolute,\nor challengeable. This opened the possibility for Locke to divide the supreme powers of the state.\nLocke\u2019s Second Treatise (1689[5]) advocated a social contract in which the state\u2019s powers,22 now free of\nany theological mandate, should be separated into 2 (executive and legislative, each taking on part of the\njudiciary\u2019s functions). Some six decades later, Montesquieu\u2019s formulation (1748[6]), extending Aristotle\u2019s\nclassification of the functions of government, proposed a separation into the well-known three branches of\ngovernment, which was later first implemented in the US constitution.\nWith a corresponding shift in the concept of the sovereign (one that has supreme authority) from the\nmonarch to the \u201cnation\u201d or the \u201cpeople,\u201d separation of powers became firmly established as the cornerstone\nof statehood. Budgeting, as one of the core elements of state power, itself evolved as an institution that\nembodied this principle as the central feature of its decision-making structure.\n1.2.2. Specificity\nEarly attention to the content of expenditures was rather loose, since it was usually broached in the context\nof taxation, tending to focus on the revenue aspect more than what the funds would be spent for once they\nwere approved. Any discussion on spending would usually be concerned more with the total amount than\nthe specifics of the contents; the purpose to which the expenditures were to be applied would probably be\nalready known or orally conveyed. It would have been a different or more delicate matter, however, to go\na step further and demand that the purpose be explicitly stated in the request, or even mandate that the\nking give his pledge not to use the approved funds for any purpose other than that stated in his request.\nYet that is precisely what budgeting would have to evolve into, to routinely incorporate such procedures to\nclarify specificity in the use of the approved funding. Besides the total amount, the content of spending, or\nhow the money will be used, is necessary information that Parliament must have in order to judge whether\nthe royal request is appropriate in purpose and size. The obvious next question to come up then would be\nwhether the funds were actually used as approved. Specifically, the first ex post follow-up question would\nbe whether the funds had not been diverted to some other purpose than that stated at the time of request.\nInitially, doing so may have been deemed an issue not very appropriate for Parliament to ask or too\nhumiliating to the king to put in writing, as it suggests a picture of subjects who do not trust their own\nmonarch\u2019s word. History notes that the first precedent was when Edward III had to give his verbal\nassurance to Parliament on two occasions, that the taxes levied for the war with Scotland in 1348 and in\n1353 would go only to that purpose. These were the first taxes to be introduced under an agreement\nbetween a monarch and the parliament with the proviso attached that the money could only be used for\nthe approved purpose (Willoughby, Willoughby and Lindsay (1917, p. 29[1]), citing Maitland (1908,\np. 184[7])).\nThe next development in the principle of specificity had to wait until after the Restoration, during the reign\nof Charles II, some three centuries later. In 1665, the king requested that Parliament approve the use of\ntaxes to fund his war with the Netherlands. This time, it demanded that the king put his agreement in writing\nas a provision in the new tax law, stating that its revenue may not be used for any purpose other than that\noriginally specified by the king.23 In the following years, this restriction of purpose became an essential\nprinciple of budgeting (specificity) that is firmly binding (Willoughby, Willoughby and Lindsay, 1917, p. 29[1];\nMaitland, 1908, p. 433[7]). These restrictions on the king\u2019s budgetary powers were soon firmly consolidated\ninto the kingdom\u2019s budget system during the Glorious Revolution in 1688, as Parliament solidified its\nhegemony. This level of control, however, did not develop into a budget system that would be recognisable\nto the modern reader insofar as it lacked formal and procedural structure and clearly articulated principles,\nwhich took a further century to evolve.\n8 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\n1.2.3. Annual appropriations\nAppropriations\nAt the heart of budgeting lies the concept of appropriation. The term is seldom used outside the context of\nbudgeting, yet even here its meaning can be ambiguous. It is often used synonymously with the annual\nbudget, but an appropriation is not necessarily limited to one year; it may well be for a multi-year period.\nAs a verb, to appropriate means to approve, to budget, to vote, or to make a decision to spend. But approval\nor decisions are also rendered for multi-year spending (or even multi-year \u201cbudgets\u201d) for a major national\nproject. More broadly, approval (by law, no less) is often given to multi-year resource ceilings in an MTEF,\nalthough such spending is almost never appropriated in its multi-year entirety \u2013 appropriation usually\ncovers only the first year of the multi-year \u201capproved\u201d plan for funding. In the US, further adding to the\nconfusion, \u201cappropriation\u201d as a term is often applied exclusively to the discretionary portion of the annual\nbudget, as opposed to the mandatory part. So how exactly is an appropriation different from all these other\nsynonyms that share the meaning of making a decision on spending?\nThe key point that distinguishes appropriations from its synonyms is whether it is truly final: may the\ngovernment go ahead and spend money that has been approved, without any further intervention or\npermission from the legislature? In this sense, by appropriating, the legislature has given its genuinely final\napproval for the government to spend the requested money. In contrast, none of the other kinds of approval\nallows the government to go ahead with \u201cexecuting\u201d or spending the approved money, unless it is explicitly\nclear that the approval means appropriation, whether the legislature\u2019s consent was approved, agreed to,\nvoted, decided, or just budgeted.\nAppropriation vs. authorisation\nFor many budgeting people throughout the world, perhaps an even greater impediment to understanding\nthe finer points of appropriations comes from another, closely related concept: authorisation. This is the\nidea, familiar from long tradition to the English and related countries, that every single spending decision\nentails two different decisions: authorisation and appropriation. However, to many, if not most, in the rest\nof the world, the idea is quite foreign and even incomprehensible \u2013 to them, a spending decision is one\nwhole, indivisible decision, the only question being whether it has been rendered with finality by the\nlegislature, at which point the government may begin spending the approved funds upon commencement\nof the fiscal year. Why would this involve two decisions, especially when the two are practically guaranteed\nto be the same? Why split hairs to such an extent?\nIn laymen\u2019s terms, authorisation is the decision that a requested spending is justified. This decision can be\nabstract in the purpose of spending, its duration, and even the amount, such as the case of recognising\nthat a ministry, e.g. for education, shall be established and be able to spend money to fulfill its purpose,\nincluding salaries, utilities, etc., the specifics of which are left for later decisions (usually appropriations) or\nregulations and laws. Within this hypothetical ministry of education, there will then be further authorisations\nwith different degrees of specificity to fund projects, programmes, and other kinds of purposes, from more\nor less permanent repeating expenses down to a one-off expenditure of a certain amount to be spent in a\ncertain year. In short, authorisation is the decision that the purpose of the requested spending is found to\nbe qualifying or worthy of expending the public\u2019s money from the treasury. Again, in many if not the majority\nof countries, this decision is simply part of the final approval in the annual budget that permits the\ngovernment to go ahead and actually spend the money, which would have been called appropriation had\nit ever been thought that the decisions were different or separable.\nBut not so in England or countries that bear its influence. The decision over whether the spending is worthy\nof receiving public funding is regarded as a decision that is distinctly different in nature from whether this\nitem, having been found worthy, then actually does get funded in the budget, and possibly by a different\n\uf07c 9\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\n(smaller) amount than what has been authorised. The former decision is what is called authorisation,\ndealing with whether the spending is justifiable; the latter, appropriation, which is the decision rendered\nafter assessing how the money will be raised and to what extent.24 Theoretically, any single spending\ndecision requires both to be approved, although one of them may be omitted or understood as implicitly\ngiven.25 Moreover, it is possible, though perhaps seldom, for the appropriated amount to be different from\nthe amount specified by the authorising decision.\nWhence appropriations?\nAt this point, the question begs repeating: why split hairs to this extent? The distinction between\nauthorisation and appropriation can be pushed as finer points of normative theory or logic for all we care,\nbut as a practical issue why quibble over something of seemingly so little significance? What gave birth in\nthe first place to the notion of distinguishing between these two concepts? We find that there was a very\ncompelling reason historically when appropriations first came to the fore of events that were ostensibly\nabout budgeting but were really a serious political contest of wills with so much at stake.\nThis was the English parliament during the first several years after Charles I took the throne in 1625. Aside\nfrom some minor developments in the mid-14th century involving Edward the Third\u2019s oral pledge to keep\nspending to the stated purpose, this is the first significant development in budgeting in more than four\ncenturies since the Magna Carta. It is by far the most important in the entire evolution of budgeting, for it\ngave us not only appropriations, but also annuality and, eventually, the vote on account. Indeed, most\naccounts of budgeting\u2019s origins agree that this single occasion by itself practically established the main\nfeatures of the modern budget system, leaving only some finishing touches to be added.26\nStourm (1917, pp. 9-18[8]) gives by far the fullest narrative of the events, including the political context both\nleading up to and following the emergence of the core concept of budgeting, appropriations. He points to\nthe second Parliament of Charles I in February 1626 as the specific occasion that produced\nappropriations:27\nThis second Parliament granted the subsidies which were demanded, postponing, however, the formality of\npassing the act until the last of the session. Thus, from 1626 on, a procedure of voting on the financial\nmeasures was inaugurated in England, which has continued to the present day. According to this procedure,\nthe appropriation act passed at the end of the session of Parliament is required to sanction all previous\nauthorizations or partial appropriations.\nStourm\u2019s description of the 1626 Parliament and its significance rightly focuses on the fact that it ended up\nfirmly stipulating parliamentary control over the budget and establishing practices that set precedents that\nwere followed continually thereafter. Recognising the leverage that appropriations gave it over the king,\nParliament would refine the tactic of limiting spending approval to amounts that would compel the king to\nreconvene the legislature for more funds every year, which solidified into the principle of annuality.28\nThe timing of this annual appropriation is also of significance. It was delayed as much as possible, to the\nlast of the parliamentary session, in order to force the Crown to spend as much as possible of its own\nmoney. This, naturally, gave Parliament a stronger position as it negotiated with the king for conditions of\nits own, besides minimising expenditures financed not by the Crown but by taxes levied on the people. But\nit also had the effect of delaying appropriations beyond the beginning of the fiscal year, a concept\nintroduced as accounting standards developed later. In the United Kingdom, appropriation bills are still\nsubmitted and passed after the beginning of each fiscal year, pursuant to the 1626 parliamentary\nresolution. Since this would leave the government without any money to spend in the first several months\nof the fiscal year, the practice emerged for granting a lump-sum spending limit without specifying the\nparticulars, sufficient for the government to continue operating for several months but not able to initiate\nany new items of spending. This became the vote on account, familiar to Commonwealth countries today.\n10 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nAgain, the crucial point that distinguishes it from all other ways of approving spending is that an\nappropriation actually makes the funds available for spending \u2013 without the appropriation act, as stated in\nthe excerpt above from Stourm, there are only so many words, but no money. All other forms of approved\nspending \u2013 be they approvals, resolutions, authorisations, agreements, votes, budgeting, etc. \u2013 merely\nsignify the legislature\u2019s favourable intent, but do not actually \u201crelease\u201d funds for spending. In particular,\nauthorisation is different from appropriation, as noted in the previous sub-section.\nBut when and how did such differentiation arise between appropriation and authorisation? After all, even\nnow, many countries regard the annual budget approval as a single indivisible decision that is meaningless\nto split further into legal semantics. To answer that question, it is instructive to refer to the records of what\nwas said or written in the speeches and messages exchanged between Parliament and Charles I during\nthis period. Volume VI of The Parliamentary History of England (1763, p. 440[9]) records that on\n27 March 1626,\n\u2026it was resolved upon the Question, \u2018That three Subsidies and three Fifteenths should be granted to his\nMajesty in this Session of Parliament, payable at three separate Times; the Bill to be brought in, when they\nhad presented their Grievances, and received his Answer to them.\u2019\nHand in Hand, with the Supply went the Commons Proceedings against the Duke. [\u2026]\nClearly there was a resolution taken in parliament, i.e. there was a vote of approval, which can also be\ncalled a decision or even authorisation, but this was merely an internal decision among members of the\nCommons. Specifically, it was not an act that actually released the sums for spending by the king. That is\nalso clear from the term \u201cBill,\u201d i.e. the bill for the appropriation act, which has not even been \u201cbrought in\u201d\nfor passage yet. The money would be made available only when this bill was brought in and passed by\nParliament. Furthermore, this granting of money is conditional on the King resolving the \u201cGrievances\u201d\nconveyed to him by Parliament. The main target of such grievances is given by the last line: the \u201cDuke\u201d of\nBuckingham, George Villiers, the most influential man in the English Court and the holder of many titles,\nincluding Lord Admiral, in many people\u2019s minds directly responsible for a string of diplomatic mishaps and\nnaval defeats.\nSo far, the excerpts above from Stourm and the Parliamentary History appear to corroborate each other in\ndescribing what different roles were played by authorisation (or resolution) and appropriation. A later entry\nin The Parliamentary History, however, appears to refute Stourm\u2019s statement that the 1626 Parliament\n\u201cinaugurated\u201d the practice of delaying the appropriation act until the last possible date. For, the\nParliamentary History gives us Parliament\u2019s \u201cRemonstrance\u201d to the king, delivered on 5 April 1626. One\npart of the Remonstrance (Ibid., (pp. 467-468[9])) is quoted at some length below:\nNow, concerning your Majesty\u2019s Servants, and, namely, the Duke of Buckingham; we humbly beseech your\nMajesty to be informed by us your faithful Commons, who can have no private End but your Majesty\u2019s Service,\nand the Good of our Country, That it hath been the ancient, constant, and undoubted Right and Usage of\nParliaments to question and complain of all Persons, of whatever Degree soever, found grievous to the\nCommon-Wealth, in abusing the Power and Trust committed to them by their Sovereign. [\u2026]\nLastly, We most humbly beseech your Majesty graciously to conceive, that though it hath been the long\nCustom of Parliament to handle the Matter of Supply with the last of their Businesses; yet at this Time,\nout of extraordinary Respect to your Person, and Care of your Affairs, we have taken the same into more\nspeedy Consideration; and most happily, on the very Day of your Majesty\u2019s Inauguration, with great Alacrity\nand unanimous Consent, after a short Debate, we grew to the Resolution for a present Supply well known to\nyour Majesty.\nTo which, if Addition may be made of other great Things for your Service, yet in Consultation amongst us, we\ndoubt not but it will appear, That we have not receded from the Truth of our Intention, so to supply you, as\nmay make you safe at home, and feared abroad; especially, if your Majesty shall be pleased to look upon\nthe Way intended in our Promise, as well as to the Measure of the Gift agreed.\n\uf07c 11\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nBy the Commons members\u2019 own words, this excerpt appears to contradict Stourm\u2019s statement that the\n1626 Parliament \u201cinaugurated\u201d the practice of delaying appropriations until the last of the session. Rather,\nCommons is reminding the king that even by that time it had already been the \u201clong custom of Parliament\u201d\nto handle the matter of supplies, or granting the king\u2019s request for funds, as their \u201clast business.\u201d This\nagrees with other writers, who say that appropriating money by consenting to taxes comes from a long\ntradition whose origins are not clear,29 differently from Stourm, who points to 1626 as the occasion that set\nan \u201cinaugurating\u201d precedent. Of course, while the 1626 parliamentary session does not appear to have\ninitiated the practice of appropriations, nor that of delaying their enactment until the last possible date, it is\nstill entirely possible that that the session may have, and probably did, firmly set up such tactics as a\nprocedure that would become one of the most inviolable features of budgeting.\nAlthough the exact origin of appropriations must therefore remain hidden in the mists of history, the above\nexcerpt, together with a fuller perusal of what transpired during the early Parliaments of Charles\u2019 reign,30\ndoes give us some insight into how appropriations developed as a useful tactic for Commons. Note first\nthe Commons is asking the king to dismiss the Duke of Buckingham,31 the King\u2019s favourite. Note also the\nlanguage of the Remonstrance \u2013 its obsequious tone goes far beyond extreme politeness. It is clear that\nParliament is by no means a true equal of the king in terms of power despite having the authority to deny\nthe king his request for taxes. Indeed, they had better be careful, for even during these sessions of\nParliament, Charles would have some Commons members arrested and thrown into prison, where they\nwere treated not too kindly if he found their behaviour or speech in Parliament particularly offensive. True,\ntaxation had required the consent of the realm since ancient times, this was acknowledged by the king\nhimself in writing since the Magna Carta, but it was still dangerous to deny or gainsay the king directly,\nespecially when broaching conditions attached to the consent.\nCommons therefore must have had long experience in developing tactics that allowed it to confront the\nking and deny his wishes, or make the granting of them conditional to the king granting their own first,\nwithout ever appearing to oppose the king directly or engage him in what would appear to be bickering\nbargaining, a notion which would naturally be too far beneath anything one would dare to presume a\nmonarch in his royal splendour would even entertain. It is quite natural to expect that Parliament would\nrefine tactics and procedures, as well as turns of speech, that allowed them to assume the pretence of\naccommodating the king\u2019s requests in favourable terms, but meanwhile as an entirely separate issue that\nis ostensibly untied to the matter at hand, take the opportunity to importune his majesty deign to listen to\nthe grievances advanced in the hope that he may graciously resolve them. Despite all the flowery words\nof agreement, however, nothing has really been consented to by Parliament \u2013 they have not made the final\ndecision, appropriations, to let the king have the money he requested, and the appropriations will obviously\nnot be coming unless the purportedly separate issue of grievances has been attended to first by the king.\nThe pretence of acquiescence, which served to appease the king even as Parliament turned on the\npressure to have him grant their \u201cuntied or independent\u201d demands first, could take on various forms of\nassenting decisions such as votes or resolutions, which Parliament would try to highlight to its own\nadvantage as accommodating good-faith gestures they had made first. The king would be quite aware,\nthough, that in the end, the gestures would remain just gestures \u2013 they would mean nothing without the\nfinal enactment. If the enactment involved any funds or money, this would have the special name,\nappropriations. Resolutions, authorisations, or even previous partial appropriations do not count: no\nappropriation, no money.\nThe following excerpts are quoted, again at some length, because it illustrates this point very vividly. First,\nfrom the \u201cAnswer\u201d by Commons some days later to a message by the king, in early March of 1626 (The\nParliamentary History, Volume VI, (pp. 429-430[9])), we have:\n\u2026 no King was ever dearer to his People, than your Majesty; no People more zealous to maintain and advance\nthe Honour and Greatness of their King than they; which as upon all Occasions they shall be ready to express,\nso especially in the Support of that Cause, wherein your Majesty and your Allies are now justly engaged. And\nbecause they cannot doubt, but your Majesty, in your great Wisdom, even out of Justice, and according to the\n12 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nExample of your most famous Predecessors, will be pleased graciously to accept the faithful and necessary\nInformation and Advice of your Parliament, which can have no End, but the Service of your Majesty; and\nSafety of your Realm, in discovering the Causes, and proposing the Remedies of these great Evils, which\nhave occasioned your Majesty\u2019s Wants, and your People\u2019s Grief. [\u2026]\nThe king\u2019s reply follows (Ibid. pp. 430\u2013431), first dismissing the grievances and making a point of not\nacknowledging them as a condition demanded for his getting the supplies. He does, however, engage in\na strong defence of Buckingham at length (omitted from the excerpt below). The ending reads, probably\nin any language, as a mildly veiled threat to Commons:\nBut for your Clause therein; of presenting of Grievances, I take that but for a Parentheses to your Speech,\nand not a Condition;\n[\u2026]\nI wish you would hasten my Supply, or else it will be worse for yourselves; for, if any Ill happen, I think I\nshall be the last that shall feel it.\nThis helps us see how the distinction between authorisation and appropriations would have developed,\nprobably gradually throughout a long period in English history, then with a particularly strong emphasis in\nthe 1626 Parliament. While appropriations eventually developed into a formal enactment that actually\ngrants the money, all the preceding reviews, adjustments, and approvals right up to, but not including,\nappropriations would have naturally evolved into its final meaning of authorisation as understood today.32\nOne could almost say that if authorisation had not existed as a separate concept from appropriations, one\nwould have been compelled to invent it as a useful negotiating tactic to delay granting the monarch\u2019s wish\nwhile keeping up the pretence that one is going along in an amicable vein. Note also that as part of this\ntactic, the appropriation act would naturally be delayed until the last of the parliamentary session;\nParliament would lose all leverage against the Crown the moment it voted to appropriate \u2013 the 1626\nParliament, as influential a precedent as it became, probably did not inaugurate the concept of\nappropriation nor the tactic of delaying it until the last of the session.\nAs a final observation on the Parliaments from 1625 to 1629, 33 Commons had a particularly strong\nmotivation, delivered repeatedly in both speech and writing to Charles I: the dismissal of the Duke of\nBuckingham. But the Duke was the young king\u2019s favourite (and had been the favourite also of his father,\nJames I), 34 so the king repeatedly ended up dissolving Parliament to protect his favourite when Commons\nturned up the pressure. As a matter of fact, although the 1626 Parliament adopted resolutions early on to\ngrant the king\u2019s requested supplies, the king ended up dissolving Parliament before this resolution was\nenacted, i.e. before the supplies were appropriated. So, he did not get his supplies. He thereafter\ndeveloped tactics of his own to \u201clegally\u201d extract money from his subjects via the inventions of \u201cship money\u201d\nand \u201cforced loans,\u201d both of which would have normally required consent from Parliament.35 This tension\ncontinued to build up and ultimately became one of the major causes of the English Civil War, as a result\nof which Charles I ended up literally losing his head.\n1.2.4. Unity and universality\nAfter the turmoil of the English Civil War and the dour intervening years under Cromwell, upon the\nRestoration, Parliament was able to solidify the gains it had made at such bloody cost. Having set the\nprecedent in 1665 during the reign of Charles II, as previously noted, that the purpose of spending\n(principle of specificity) had to be put into writing, the definitive occasion for Parliament to establish its\nauthority in national affairs came with the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and the Coronation Oath Act in the\nsame year. The latter act provided for an oath to be taken by the newly invited co-monarchs, William III\nand Mary II, and all future monarchs, requiring them to\n\u201cGoverne [\u2026] according to the Statutes in Parlyament Agreed on and the Laws and Customs [\u2026].\u201d\n\uf07c 13\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nThe monarch is now by his own oath unquestionably subject to the law, and not above it.\nThereupon, as a result of the increase in its powers, Parliament steadily extended its control over the\nCrown\u2019s expenditures. Most importantly, it began and extended the limits set on routine expenditures even\nfor those paid for out of the Crown\u2019s own income. Restrictions on the expenditures of the Crown continued\nto grow until the late 18th century. In exchange for the Crown relinquishing non\u2010tax sources of revenue,\nParliament granted it rights to special taxes, such as a liquor tax.36 Recompensing the king for relinquishing\nrevenue from properties and authorities inherited from previous monarchs, Parliament would grant the\nmonarch control of certain taxes (which, strictly speaking, Parliament still managed). But because these\ntaxes were not inheritable, parliament had stronger control over the revenues and expenditures of newly\ncrowned monarchs. Parliament also separated the royal palace\u2019s expenses from the state\u2019s expenses with\nthe creation of separate funds. This allowed the royal expenditures to be identified readily, which thereby\nlaid the foundation for controlling royal expenditures, as Parliament proceeded to set limits on usage of\nroyal funds (Maitland, 1908, pp. 434\u2010435[7]). Over about a century following the Glorious Revolution,\nParliament\u2019s control had finally been extended to cover all spending by the state, including those of the\nroyal household \u2013 roughly, unity and universality had been achieved.\nThe Consolidated Fund\nIn 1787, Parliament took actions that added the finishing touch to the British budget system for all practical\npurposes. The development of the budget system by the British parliament can be understood as a process\nof separating the royal treasury and public sources of revenue. It was not until the 18th century that the\nseparation was completed in the form of the Consolidated Fund. As originally conceived, and observed to\nthis day, all national revenues and expenditures go through the Consolidated Fund. In addition,\nexpenditures are divided into Consolidated Fund Services and Supply Services. Even though both are\nincluded in the appropriations (budgets) approved at the end of parliamentary sessions, the former includes\nexpenditures directly paid for from the Consolidated Fund without a separate review by Parliament, as is\ndone for mandatory expenditures in the United States. However, the Consolidated Fund Services mostly\nconsist of interest costs and the wages of judicial officials,37 which is quite different from the contents of\nmandatory expenditures in the United States.\n1.2.5. Clarifying the role of the legislature\nBesides extending the scope of the budget throughout the 18th century, another very important precedent\nwas set by Parliament. By limiting spending proposals and amendments by the legislature, Parliament\nclarified the division of responsibilities in budgeting between itself and the Crown. Thereafter, Parliament\nwas not to initiate any spending, whether in the budget or in any other legislation \u2013 it was the Crown\u2019s role\nto propose spending, the legislature would only decide whether to consent to the requested spending or\nperhaps reduce it. The precedent\u2019s influence was not limited to the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth\nbut subsequently had great impact on the budget systems of other countries as well. In terms of the\nstandard framework of budgeting powers, this principle pertains not so much to the budgeting principles\nsuch as annuality, etc., applicable to the interactions between the actors within the specified framework;\nbut served to strengthen the basic budgeting framework itself in how it assigned different roles between\nthe government and the legislature. The resolution amounts to nothing less than the first explicit recognition\nof the government\u2019s budgetary initiative that is an important part of the separation of budgetary powers,\nobserved by all countries today, not just the UK or Commonwealth countries.\nIn 1706, during the reign of Queen Anne, Parliament adopted a resolution that embodied one of the most\ncrucial rules for budgeting and made it a Standing Order (SO) of the House of Commons in 1713. The\nStanding Order banned parliament members from proposing any bill that stood to incur expenditures from\nthe national treasury without the consent of the Crown. This ban prohibited parliament members\u2019 proposal\nof any bill involving the formulation, submission, or even increasing amendment of the budget. It explicitly\n14 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nlimited the budgetary initiative to government, i.e. clearly, the budget proposal could only come now from\nthe government. Furthermore, it also forbade amendments that increased items within the proposed\nbudget or adding new items thereto. But the resolution applied even beyond budget proposals and possible\namendments; it represented a restriction far more powerful than the requirement adopted by many\ncountries today that budget increases by the legislature must obtain governmental consent, for the\nstanding order also prohibited all expense\u2010incurring bills, even those other than appropriation bills.\nThis provision later became known throughout budgeting worldwide as Standing Order 6638 because it\nwas the first prohibition on budget increases by the legislature, an influential key principle of budgeting\nwhich is often stipulated in the constitutions or laws of many other countries across the world even now.\nFor instance, even in countries where the legislature is allowed to increase individual items in the\ngovernment\u2019s proposal, there is usually the requirement for an offsetting reduction in some other items, so\nthat the net result should leave the total sum unchanged or not increased. Likewise, the usual prohibition\non new items being initiated by the legislature also reflects the spirit of the standing order. While the four\nbudgeting principles39 are designed to help Parliament discourage questionable spending by the Crown,\nin contrast the purpose of SO 66 is to restrict Parliament\u2019s own spending impulses. It is the cornerstone of\nthe UK\u2019s strong record on fiscal soundness; countries that have similar-looking but more lenient restrictions\non their legislature\u2019s powers of budgetary amendments tend to have weaker discipline and their finances\nusually have not fared as well.40\n1.2.6. Recapitulation\nIn sum, England grew and maintained stipulated restrictions on royal power for centuries following the\nMagna Carta in the early 13th century. By the 17th century, the restrictions had gradually evolved to create\na more or less modern budget system with features that served as a model for budget systems worldwide.41\nHere, rather than focusing on the detailed specifics, we would like to highlight the principle that guided the\ndevelopment of the budget system\u2014namely, the principle of separation of powers. The budget system that\nhad developed over centuries in England spread to other European countries during the 19th century, as\nthe concept of state power as articulated by Hobbes (1651[4]) and later by Locke (1689[5]) greatly influenced\nthe political landscape in Europe as well. Lastly, even though England was the first country to develop the\nkey features of a budget system, the country stopped short of developing a formal system with precisely\ndefined features, as development of the budget system peaked in the late 18th century. Thereafter,\nrefinement of the budget system and the theoretical or conceptual development of rationales for the system\nwere carried out by France in the 19th century.\n1.3. Propagation: from Autocracy to Democracy\nWe now turn to the question of propagation: how did the world get from the origin in England, a single\npoint, to the current, ubiquitous presence of the same model in all countries?42 Unfortunately, the following\nattempt to answer that question in this section must remain somewhat incomplete and of lesser rigor than\nother parts of this paper, occasionally allowing conjectures to intermingle with known facts. It will not try to\nbe comprehensive, either, but there is still a common theme running through all parts. That would be the\nnature of sovereignty and how it relates to budgeting.\n1.3.1. Chronological overview\nInstead of trying to track the beginnings of budget systems in different countries directly, I will follow a\nstrategy of going by the timeline of constitutions. This has the advantage of avoiding the trouble of\npinpointing inceptive events in budgeting, which may not be very clearly differentiable at the originating\npoint from any existing machinery used by autocratic monarchies to manage their finances. As we have\n\uf07c 15\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nalready seen, the constitution is closely related to budgeting, whose operation and very existence requires\nthe principle of separation of powers to be firmly declared by the constitution. 43 The chronology of\nconstitutions is therefore correlated with the introduction and evolution of modern budgeting ideas.\nLate 18th century\nThe first three written constitutions were adopted in this period.44 The USA\u2019s constitution, the first to\nembody Montesquieu\u2019s (1748[6]) separation of powers, was ratified and went into effect in 1789; Poland,\nin May 1791; and France, in September 1791, two years after the Revolution. The Polish constitution will\nnot be considered as the country was overrun by its neighbours the following year and lost its sovereignty\nfor 123 years, until the end of World War I in 1918.\nThe US constitution does not make reference to a budget or any systematic method of determining the\nnation\u2019s expenses. The only provision related to spending is given in Section 9 of Article 1, which stipulates,\n\u201cNo money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law, and a\nregular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published\nfrom time to time.\u201d This shows that any spending by the government required the approval of Congress as\na law, but it was only in 1921 that a budget system was introduced in the US.\nThe French constitution of 1791 gives sovereignty to the \u201cnation,\u201d under a constitutional monarchy.45 It did\nnot forget to say that the important matters of establishing public expenditures and taxes were exclusively\ndelegated to the legislative body (Article 1 of Section I, Chapter III, Title III).46 There is also a short Title V\non public taxes, one of whose five articles mandates reports on ministerial departments\u2019 expenditures.\nHowever, Stourm offers the opinion, both his own and quotes from other sources as well, that interest in\npublic finances initially centred mostly on the revenue side, there being nothing resembling a budget. Only\nby laws in 1817 and 1831 did the legislature establish its right to control the government\u2019s expenditures\n(Stourm, 1917, pp. 48-49[8]), to see a modern budget emerge in the late 1800s.\nNineteenth century\nProbably influenced by the French Revolution and subsequent Napoleonic conquests, the earlier part of\nthe nineteenth century Europe witnessed political volatility and unrest as the liberal spirit swept over the\ncontinent, challenging the established age-old model of statehood, monarchy. France itself would oscillate\nbetween monarchy and republicanism throughout the century, trying out variations of institutions devised\nto allow the state to function properly under the unfamiliar and continually shifting political configurations.\nOther countries in Europe, although virtually all remaining monarchies for the century, likewise struggled\nto find a workable balance between the new liberal demands of the times and the existing model of\norganising state power defined around the monarch.\nThe early adapters\nNaturally, there were differences in attitudes as to how European monarchies accommodated the need to\nshare what had been their monolithic hold on power with the emerging liberal or democratic demands. The\nearly constitutions, Spain in 1812, Norway and the Netherlands in 1814, Portugal in 1822, and Belgium in\n1831,47 were all inspired by the liberal ideas of the times, including parliamentary representation and\nseparation of powers, as well as parliamentary approval of government spending. In particular, the liberal\ntendencies of the Spanish and Portuguese examples may have had some trans-oceanic impact as well,\non Brazil and other Latin American countries that gained independence around this time. Except for a brief\ninitial period when some countries began as empires, unlike the mother countries all of these former\ncolonies were quick to adopt the American presidential system. With separation of powers as a key\nprinciple, this meant that the basic conditions for a modern budget system were in place. Beyond that\nobservation, further details of how budgeting developed in these countries will not be pursued, as they\n16 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nwould fall beyond the scope of this paper and, regretfully, also the competence of the author. It is probably\nsafe to say, however, that the Napoleonic conquests of Iberia and Habsburgian Austria provided a golden\nopportunity for the Latin American countries to wrest independence from their masters, similarly to most of\nthe European countries mentioned above.\nThe latecomers\nInstead, we turn to examine two later cases where the monarch was reluctant to embrace the liberal ideals.\nTo allay mounting political pressure, the monarch would introduce a constitution that ostensibly subscribed\nto the usual separation of three powers. But he still considered himself above the law, or even the\nconstitution, when important issues came to a head. The constitutions in these cases show considerable\ndiscomfort over this latent internal contradiction, and even attempt to obfuscate the issue of limiting the\nmonarch\u2019s powers, suggesting instead that the monarch was the source of the constitution\u2019s legitimacy.\nThe first case is Prussia,48 whose 1850 constitution (replacing an earlier version in 1848) drew much\ninternational attention because of a constitutional crisis that erupted shortly over the budget. It was\nmodelled after the Belgian constitution of 1831, regarded as the most advanced at the time. But unlike the\nBelgian Article 115 that stated the budget must be approved by the legislature but is not a law, the Prussian\nversion stated explicitly in Article 99 that the budget shall be annually fixed by a law (Sakurai, 2004[10]).\nThe budget crisis erupted when, for a period of four years beginning in 1862, the government under\nBismarck continued to collect taxes and disburse funds despite the legislature\u2019s refusal to approve the\nbudget. To the legislature, the four years of spending without a budget approved by it was therefore in\nclear violation of the constitution. As later explained by an American political scientist, the government did\nnot agree (Robinson, 1894[11]). For, in the German legal tradition, \u201cThe king is not only one of the factors\nin legislation, he is the law-giver himself,\u201d especially having declared himself in the constitution\u2019s preamble\nas King of Prussia \u201cby grace of God.\u201d That is, he believes that he possesses his political powers in his own\nright. It is interesting to note that the Prussian constitution, perhaps rather intentionally, avoids any\ndeclaration of sovereignty, whereas its original models from Belgium and France explicitly declared that\nsovereignty belongs to the \u201cnation.\u201d\nSome 25 years later, the first Japanese constitution, known as the Meiji Constitution of 1889, 49 was\nmodelled after the Prussian Constitution. Having a German constitutional scholar, Hermann Roesler,50\namong them, the five-man drafting committee headed by Ito Hirobumi was keenly aware of the problem of\nsovereignty, which they wanted to preserve as an absolute monarchy.51 This was not easily reconcilable\nwith separation of powers and could lead to the same kind of controversies as Prussia, in legislation and,\nmore specifically, the budget. The solution they devised was to take the exact opposite stance of the\nPrussian case: the Emperor was explicitly declared the source of all power and legitimacy, and the budget\nwas defined as not a law, although this time, unlike Prussia\u2019s Article 99, this was not explicitly stated in the\nconstitution.52\nThe concurrently released official English translation of the Meiji Constitution says the budget requires the\n\u201cconsent\u201d of the Diet (Art. 64), but the Japanese original fudges the issue with a new word minted especially\nfor this occasion, whose literal translation is \u201ccooperative agreement\u201d (\u5354\u8d0a). That is, the Diet must agree\nwith the government\u2019s proposal, made on behalf of the Emperor. This ambiguous word also appears in two\nother places in the Meiji Constitution: Articles 5 and 37, which concern the Emperor\u2019s legislating powers\n(a broader concept than budgeting) in relationship to the Diet. Note the budget is not a law in Japan, so the\ninstances of \u201cconsent\u201d in the latter two articles do not apply to budgeting, requiring a separate explicit\naffirmation (Article 64) of the Diet\u2019s authority, or the lack thereof, in the budgeting decision.\nBy the end of the 19th century, virtually all European countries and Japan had budget systems firmly\nestablished atop national constitutions. The reader will be pleased to learn that any such anomalies in\nconstitutions or budgeting as described above have long since been smoothed out in these countries,\nespecially following the end of World War II in the 20th century.\n\uf07c 17\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nTwentieth century\nThe US budget system\nThe first prominent case in the 20th century also happens to be the last of the latecomers among the\nWestern countries. Ironically, this was the first country to adopt a written constitution, but the last to have\na budget system. Around the turn of the century, the need for a national budgeting system increasingly\ngathered attention and received a decisive boost when William Taft made it a central issue of his\npresidency (1909-1913) and delivered a report on the subject to Congress in 1912. 53 His successor,\nWoodrow Wilson (1913-1921), coming from an academic background in political science and public\nadministration, also was a strong advocate of national budgeting.\nProgress at Congress to adopt a budget system was not very smooth, however, doubtless because of the\nintervening years of the first World War, but also because the system of budgeting being proposed was\nthe European model. This was the only existing model of budgeting at the time available for the US to refer\nto, but its defining feature was the presence of a very powerful finance minister to make the system work.\nThis did not fit very well with the political configuration of the US, in which Congress had long enjoyed a\nclear dominance in national affairs. For, it had been founded decades before it adopted the Constitution\nand elected the first president, during which time it had also waged and won the war of independence from\nthe British. Embracing the European model built around a strong finance minister would end up shifting\nthe balance of powers, however slightly, in favour of the government. This, Congress was not willing to\nconcede easily, when even within Congress fierce battles were occasionally waged over which committee\nhad jurisdiction over choice parts of spending.54\nThere was also the more practical issue of whether a constitutional amendment would be required to\naccommodate the European model, which would have complicated matters even further. Uniquely among\ncountries at the time,55 the US constitution did not allow the government to introduce bills of law (the\nlegislative initiative), reserving that right solely for Congress. Since the Constitution stipulated that no\nspending could occur but in consequence of appropriations made by law, the budget draft that the\nEuropean model would have the government produce would have to be a bill of law. But that would require\nan amendment to the constitution for the legislature to share with the government its exclusive prerogative\nto introduce bills, at least for budgeting.\nIn the end, two workaround solutions were found that allowed the US to adopt national budgeting with the\n1921 Budget and Accounting Act. These workarounds give the US budget system its peculiar\ncharacteristics that make it different from other countries\u2019 systems. The first is to split the process of\nintroducing the draft budget. The draft is compiled by the government, as in other countries but, called the\n\u201cPresident\u2019s Budget,\u201d is not considered a bill of law. The appropriation bill to be legislated into the budget\nlaw is then introduced as a separate document originating in the Appropriations Committees in both\nHouses.56 The second workaround was that US Congress also reserved for itself markedly greater powers\nto amend the budget, compared to the European model. Against these more significant amendments, the\nUS constitution does not recognise partial (line-item) vetoes by the President, which severely limits the\nformal means available to him to object to questionable changes or additions to the budget made by\nCongress. The Constitution only allows him to veto the entire budget bill, which makes it practically and\npolitically too costly to put into frequent use.57\nOther countries\nThis covers almost all countries in Africa and Asia, including the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent.\nFor virtually all of them, the incipient occasion was liberation from long periods of occupation or\ncolonisation, brought on by the end of World War II. Although the process of liberation was often delayed\nby a further decade or two after the war, all shared the sense of urgency to solidify the newly found\nindependence as a sovereign country. For most, it was also the first time in their histories to establish a\n18 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nmodern country, with constitutions and state institutions modelled after the Western \u201cadvanced\u201d countries,\nincluding budget systems.\nThe newly independent countries did not have the leisure of allowing the constitution and institutions to\nevolve naturally or to await the reasonable resolutions of all pending issues. As a result, in most cases\neach of them ended up with a system that closely resembled what they knew through experience, 58\noccasionally tempered with features taken from other types of systems. Thus, most countries formerly\nunder British rule adopted parliamentary systems of government, with budget systems that are set up very\nmuch like the UK system. Many, if not most, of the other countries followed the model of the clear leader\nto emerge from World War II but took care to avoid the US system\u2019s two peculiarities, perhaps influenced\nby the desire to have a strong national leader. Except for the Philippines, all their constitutions gave the\nlegislative initiative also to the government, and furthermore clearly stipulated that the draft budget bill\noriginate in the government. They also allowed the government to exercise partial veto rights, or, for the\nbudget, imposed the restriction that limited amendments by the legislature, usually by having the\nconstitution stipulate that any increases or new items introduced by the legislature would require the\nconsent of the government.\nFor this final group of countries reviewed, which probably also comprises the largest number of countries,\na clarification is in order. Compared to other countries discussed earlier, these countries have had much\nless or no experience and time to have developed traditions and institutions, much less formal systems,\nfor robust popular sovereignty. Nor would they necessarily have had the time or political development to\nhave generated a truly viable demand in the first place for popular sovereignty, having newly come from\ncenturies of monarchic rule and subsequent imperialistic domination by another country. For some, and\nprobably many, in this group, the \u201cWestern\u201d model of budgeting may have been adopted not necessarily\nso much to ensure democratic separation of powers, but with efficient allocation and control of resources\nas the main rationale in mind. However, it should be noted that this observation does not negate the main\nthesis advanced in this paper, as the two possible motivations for embracing the \u201cWestern\u201d budgeting\nmodel are rather entirely orthogonal to each other: one does not preclude the other possibility. Namely,\nthe efficiency viewpoint does not negate the popular-sovereignty-oriented interpretation presented here.\nThe budget is in fact most definitely useful for good, tight planning to allocate resources needed for some\nworthy objectives, usually national economic and social development. This holds true even for autocratic\nregimes. Notable examples in history include the Enabling Act of Germany under Hitler\u2019s rule (1933 \u2013\n1945), which allowed the Diet to be explicitly bypassed altogether by the government as it proclaimed the\nannual budget and laws unilaterally. The Russian budget system was introduced in the last several years\nof the empire before its downfall, but in the first couple of years the Duma (legislature) did not even exist,\nso whatever budget in that period necessarily was determined alone by the government itself. Much later\nin latter half of the 20th century, during the earlier several decades of economic development in the author\u2019s\nown country, it is common knowledge that the political, legislative, and budgetary systems were actually\ndominated by a strong autocratic leader, even as formally in outward appearances the constitutional\ndecision-making framework subscribed to the standard separation of powers that is the hallmark of proper\ndemocracy. Indeed, similar observations have been advanced for the other Asian countries (the \u201ctigers\u201d)\nthat have more or less concurrently achieved comparable economic growth to the Korean case.\nRecall, however, that the budget system we have been discussing precludes unilateral decisions by the\ngovernment; as defined, it must (if only in formal appearances) obtain the approval of the legislature, which\nconstitutes a power that is (albeit sometimes only supposedly) independent of and fully separated from\ngovernment. Note that this characterisation actually does hold in a literal if somewhat superficial sense for\nvirtually all of the world\u2019s countries today.59 Under this definition, democracy and the modern budget\nsystem are prerequisites, or necessary conditions to each other. But autocratic, efficiency-oriented budget\nsystems, similarly to the examples listed in the previous paragraph, may still very well avail themselves of\nthe Western budgeting model, as some have done to good effect. Strictly speaking, however, they only\n\uf07c 19\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nresemble but may not exactly fit the model of budgeting as defined in the Introduction to this paper, insofar\nas the stipulation goes that the budgeting decision be made with authorities split between the legislature\nand the government to achieve checks and balances.\nIn the extreme case, an autocratic regime may choose to follow what we regard as the \u201cWestern\u201d budgeting\nmodel in every single aspect except for the decision-making process built on the principle of checks and\nbalances \u2013 strictly speaking, such a country would have government or state expenditure plans, but not a\nmodern budget under our working definition60 for this paper. For an autocratic system seeking to maximise\nefficient use of resources, the choice of the \u201cWestern\u201d model of budgeting, when it pertains to the part of\nseparated budgeting powers as the key feature, is therefore really optional \u2013 they may choose to, but are\nnot compelled to, adopt this particular feature, even as they emulate all other features of the model for\ngood spending plans. Nonetheless, the truly salient point for us has to be the fact that virtually all countries\u2019\nconstitutions today actually do mandate this \u201coptional\u201d feature explicitly,61 even though many are ruled by\nrather autocratic leaders (compared to their Western counterparts). Presumably, at least a nod of\nacknowledgment to a framework of separated powers was deemed important enough.62\nThe last two sentences deserve further elaborating emphasis. First, as all countries do subscribe to a\nmodel of separated powers (again, perhaps only in superficial appearances), that information in itself\ncannot have any power to predict63 whether or not budgeting decisions are actually rendered in a checks\u0002and-balances framework, or whether that principle was actually a serious consideration when the\nconstitution and budget system were formally defined \u2013 it will still be possible for an autocratic government\nto be only interested in efficient resource allocation but not in having its plans actually subject to\nindependent scrutiny. Second, despite that, the notion of popular sovereignty based on separated powers\nis still important enough that all countries did end up choosing to profess adherence to that principle in\ntheir constitutions and budget systems. Thus, the fact that the budgeting model may pursue good planning\non expenditures independently of the pursuit of democratic values, by and in itself still does not negate our\ninterpretation64 of why Asian and African countries, the last group to gain independence after WWII, chose\nto adopt the Western model of budgeting, usually along with familiar political systems based on popular\nsovereignty.\nFinally, it should be noted that the converse does not hold. Logically, autocracies have an optional choice\nto not implement separation of powers within the budgeting framework (which none have exercised in their\nconstitutions and organic budget laws). But in contrast democratic regimes do not have a choice of\nfollowing a different decision framework. For the latter, budgeting is important and influential enough as a\nstate power that it must itself be set up to replicate separation of powers for its decisions. Constitutions\nand budget systems with separated powers may not be sufficient by themselves for one to adjudge the\nstate of democracy in a particular country; nevertheless, they comprise an absolute prerequisite or a\nnecessary condition for countries that do aspire to the values of popular sovereignty.\n1.3.2. The final stone: France\nTempting as it is to summarily wrap up the discussion by concluding that the English invented budgeting,\nprudence advises we unturn one final stone. That would be France, which has played a prominent and\noften leading role throughout European history, especially in matters of government and state institutions.\nMight not French history point to certain developments of its own, which from its standpoint may be claimed\nas pivotal inceptive events that eventually evolved into a full-fledged budget system? Would such events\nhave unfolded more or less in parallel to, or perhaps even have preceded the events in England? This\nsection probes for any surprises that may still lie hidden under the last proverbial stone.\n20 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nEtymological origin\nThe first, rather trivial, issue concerns the term \u201cbudget\u201d itself, especially as it comes from Latin/French\norigins; namely, \u201cbouge,\u201d meaning leather bag, or its diminutive, \u201cbougette.\u201d Having crossed the Channel\ninto the English language around the 15th century, it came to mean the bag that the Prime Minister used\nto bring the budget documents to Parliament, then eventually the documents themselves in the early to\nmid-18th century. That the English used the word budget in the latter sense is backed by incontrovertible\nproof by a printed memorandum circulated by the Prime Minister Robert Walpole ([12]) himself in 1733, The\nBudget Opened, or an Answer to a Pamphlet. By 1764, it is clear that the word had come to refer to the\ndocument and not the bag that contains it.65\nBut do the French concur that the word, although originally from French roots, was given its current\nmeaning by the English, and not themselves? Stourm (Ibid., pp. 4\u20135), himself a Frenchman and the\ncontemporary authority on the budget system, provides an unequivocal answer: \u201cThe philological origin of\nthe word \u201cbudget\u201d is English: [\u2026] All treatises on the subject give this as its origin.\u201d Furthermore, he reports\nthat the French regarded the word with disdain as vulgar and did not deign to use it, quoting Jean-Baptiste\nSay:66 \u201cBudget, a barbarian word, even in England, where it has lost its original meaning, and which we\nwould replace justly by calling the thing by its real name, i.e. a balance between the needs and the\nresources of the State.\u201d Stourm concludes his investigation by observing that in France, \u201cPublic documents\nbegan to use the word \u201cbudget\u201d only a few years after the beginning of the nineteenth century.\u201d67\nBefore the Revolution\nTurning now to substantive developments in budgeting, rather than quibbling over mere nomenclatural\nprecedence, did the French have events or milestones that were comparable to or even preceded the\nEnglish? Stourm, after a lengthy first chapter on the English experience, devotes the whole next chapter\nto discussing the French case in detail. Although he valiantly highlights events that would paint his country\nin the best favourable light, his own recapitulation summarises the limitations of the French system of\npublic finances before the fall of the ancien regime, quoted several times at some length below.\nOf the \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux, which is reported to have some representativeness since the early 1300s,68 but\nnot to the degree enjoyed by the English Parliament, Stourm notes that it was called infrequently,\nirregularly, and did not have authority to effectively check the king\u2019s wishes or commands. That is, it lacks\nthe regularity and authority to be considered as meaningful ground gained toward an eventual budget\nsystem:\nRecapitulating, except during the reigns of John the Good [Jean le Bon] and Charles VII, we do not find more\nthan five or six assemblies on the average in every century. These assemblies were convened without any\nregularity whatever. Moreover, we must omit from the number all the simple assemblies of notables which\nunjustly assumed the name of \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux.\nFrom this it appears that the institution as such was inoperative, or rather say, that it acted without authority;\nthis is demonstrated by the list of dates as given above, as well as by the countless cases where royalty\nimposed and levied taxes on the basis of its own authority. Taking it in all, until 1791, taxes seldom originated\nby approval of the representatives of the country.\nBefore the fateful final \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux that ignited the Revolution in 1789, the last time it was convened\nwas in 1614 \u2013 a lapse of 175 years, as is well known. In Stourm\u2019s words, this was a period where there\nwas no national entity that could effectively check the monarch\u2019s demands, and hence for our purposes,\ndefinitely a period with no budget system:\nThe Period of the ''Parlements\": From 1614 on, as we have stated, the \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux ceased to be convened.\nUntil 1789, or for 175 years, the Crown governed alone; imposed taxes and regulated expenditures at will\nwithout the cooperation of the representatives of the country. From then on the absolute power of the king was\nto be opposed by the Parlements.\n\uf07c 21\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\n\u2018Parlements\u2019 not Representative: The Parlement attempted, in fact, to arrogate to itself the right to control the\npurse of which the representatives of the country had been deprived. But this effort could be nothing more than\na sham because the Parlement which neither the people nor any part of the nation elected did not represent\nanybody. Their office, acquired by purchase, conferred on them no legislative powers. Montesquieu said of\nthem: \"The Parlement publishes the laws after the laws are passed, and reminds the people of the laws when\nthey have been forgotten.\u201d The publication of the laws by the Parlement was simply a formality; it involved no\nright, no power to ratify the laws of the country, much less those dealing with taxes. And what value could lie\nin a legislative right, if it existed, when a Lit de Justice was sufficient to permit the king \u2014 who was received\nwith much pomp and seated on an elevated throne \u2014 to order forthwith the registration of edicts?\n[\u2026]\nThus during the entire reign of Louis XIV, no check, not even an apparent one, was applied to the absolute\npower of the King. The \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux were discontinued and the Parlements silenced. The latter did not\nregain the possession of their ancient right of protest until 1715, from which date they maintained them until\nthe Revolution.\nClearly there is no budget system to speak of at all after 1614, much less one that is comparable in any\ndegree to England. Regarding the period before 1614, a body of representative nature does exist in the\n\u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux, but aside from a markedly nominal concept that the monarch ought to obtain the consent\nof the people for taxes, there is no effective authority or explicitly expressed rule that can be put into actual\nuse. Again, there can be no budget system; or, if there is some rudimentary, notional system, it is ineffective\nenough that one cannot expect any further improvement or evolution from that basis:\nIn order to explain this contradiction between the theory and the facts and at the same time to excuse the\nflagrant violations of the public law committed by royalty and which royalty did not even defend, it has been\nalleged that the \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux were incapable of performing their constitutional functions.\nBailly's statement in his Histoire financi\u00e8re is certainly true: \u201cThe \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux in France convened once in\na great while, and composed as they were of individuals not acquainted with public affairs and not having the\ntime to gain any experience, they did not know how to specify or how to carry out their rights.\"\nOverall, right up to the French Revolution in 1789 \u2013 which came almost exactly a century later than\nEngland\u2019s Glorious Revolution, by which time England already had evolved most of the main features of\nbudgeting \u2013 there was almost no significant event or development in budgeting that could be regarded as\ncomparable to the English case, except for one potentially important point. That would be the idea that\ntaxation requires the consent of the people, which turned out to be the founding premise that eventually\nhelped other important ideas to emerge later, such as separation of powers or budgeting.\nThe principle was widely recognised by the French, very much like the belief that the English had already\nheld for some time before demanding its written inclusion in the Magna Carta of 1215. However, the earliest\nrecorded recognition of this principle in France also comes roughly a century after the Charter. Moreover,\nunlike in England, the idea appears to have remained just that: a notional idea that was mostly ignored by\nthe monarch more or less with impunity \u2013 the \u00c9tats G\u00e9n\u00e9raux rarely, if ever, explicitly brought it up as a\npoint of contest. In short, the French failed to make this important principle count, whereas the English\nmost definitely did.\nAt this point we already have a definitive answer to our question: no surprises lay hidden under the final\nstone. Budgeting did originate in England, and not France: in its history right up to the French Revolution,\nthe latter would find it difficult to point to evidence of its own to argue for comparable achievements or\nprogress at the formative stages of the budget system. Let us now consider events after the fall of the\nancien regime.\n22 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nAfter the Revolution\nHaving established that budgeting was invented by the English, does it follow that France merely followed\nin those footsteps just to replicate a variant adapted to their own circumstances? The short answer is that,\nalthough the English had already introduced and established practically all of the key principles and\nfeatures of modern budgeting, the French at that point still did add a significant contribution of their own\nby putting the final finishing touches to this new but very important institution for managing the state\u2019s\nfinances. The English, as they often do, even with their constitution, may have been content to leave\nmatters to traditions, precedents, or more explicit statements scattered over numerous sources without\nany serious effort at consolidation, but that simply would not do for the French. Their temperament\ndemanded that such an important new system had to be compactly codified in one document or law that\nwas clear, complete, and coherent. The task entailed stating, and in many cases, defining concepts,\nprocedures, and the involved authorities with greater rigorous precision so as to iron out any ambiguity or\ninconsistencies. The significance of this contribution by the French is that the subsequent propagation to\nother countries was greatly facilitated by having available an explicitly and precisely spelled out system\nthey could refer to as they designed their own systems. This occurred mainly in two phases: Europe and\nLatin America during the 19th century, and then in the 20th century, particularly in the post-colonial rush to\nindependence after World War II.\nAs already noted above, following the Revolution, the Assembly quickly re-established the right to\ndetermine taxes through the Constitution of 1791, reconfirmed by law in 1817. The right to intervene in\nspending, however, remained unclear until unequivocally established by law in 1831. That is, it took some\nfour decades after the Revolution to determine whether the legislature ought to have this right or leave\nspending entirely at the discretion of the executive \u2014 a non-trivial length of time to settle even the basic\nassignments of budgetary authorities. Certainly, the process was not helped by the reversion to monarchy,\nby Napoleon as emperor (1804\u20131814, 1815) and the subsequent Bourbon Restoration. Napoleon, in\nparticular, was known to be quite autocratic at the Assembly\u2019s expense, treating it with almost complete\ndisregard in both constitutional and budgetary affairs.\nOver the long run, however, the French budget system probably benefitted more from Napoleon\u2019s influence\nthan it suffered from the ostensible setbacks in the short run. The underlying spirit of his two greatest\nachievements, the Napoleonic Code and the metric system, carried over into the budget system as well,\nmaking it an authoritative standard that aimed at the same kind of precision, clarity, and\ncomprehensiveness. Progress in this respect can be summarised as two key achievements: the earlier\nseries of reforms by Baron Louis, and the Imperial Decree of 1862. In a series of enactments that\nstrengthened centralised management of taxation and expenditures, Baron Louis, finance minister (1814\u2013\n1815, 1815\u20131819, 1831\u20131832), was responsible for refining the key concepts and principles that the\nEnglish had been content to leave rather loose-ended.69 The later Imperial Decree of 1862 focused on\ntightening the link between the budget and government accounting to strengthen accountability and central\ncontrol. This meant that budgeting had to be even further refined to be compatible with the more precise\nand exacting standards that accounting demands.\nThat the significance of these belated post-Revolution, indeed, post-Napoleonic, French contributions to\nbudgeting should not be discounted lightly is corroborated by the behaviour of the European neighbours,\nwho invariably incorporated the salient features developed by the French into their own systems.70 In a\nsimilar vein, there is also testimony from the English side, that by the 1860s the French system had evolved\nto a level that the originating English system would do well to give some serious attention: Balfour\u2019s report\nto the Statistical Society (Ibid.) gives a thorough, detailed comparison of budgeting in the two countries,\ngenerally finding the English system to be lacking the greater control and accountability made possible by\nits French counterpart.\nRelative to the English origination, how much significance can or ought to be accorded the later French\ncontribution? The answer would depend on the context and the perspective or orientation of each person\n\uf07c 23\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nanswering that question. There will always be those who value the beginning above all later developments.\nOn the other extreme end, a persuasive case could probably be easily made that the modern budget\nsystem was born only when the final completing efforts produced a cohesive and comprehensive system\nfor the first time. Thankfully, this paper does not have to adjudicate this debate. The question addressed\nby this paper is a much simpler one: when, where and what are the origins of modern budgeting? Despite\nfeatures that may not have yet been formed properly at the time of origin, can we identify the earliest buds\nof budgeting, not the full blossom that now dominates the world? Not involving any other judgement of\nvalue or significance, we have shown that the simple answer to that question points quite conclusively to\nEngland.71\n1.3.3. One final look at England\nProgress against weak monarchs\nThe implicit theme underlying budgeting\u2019s historical emergence is that it is an inextricable part of\ndemocracy, in the sense that its conceptual rationale and actual evolution depended on a scheme of\nseparated powers within the state, while itself constituting an essential part of maintaining and further\nreinforcing that separation, or division of powers. The argument for such an interpretation of budgeting can\nbe built on an entirely conceptual basis, relying on logical reasoning to show that budgeting and the\nevolution of democratic principles and institutions are closely linked to each other. Alternatively, the\nhistorical review of English budgeting history in the first section suggests a different way to test the\nsoundness of that interpretation. In the modern spirit of testing a null hypothesis against observed facts,\nwill the history of English budgeting bear out our interpretation? As a very rough and informal test, will we\nbe able to confirm that the sporadic events that pushed the development of budgeting occurred only, or\nmainly, when the monarch was too weak to defend his powers against budgeting\u2019s encroachment? On the\nother hand, were the answer to turn out in the negative, showing these events instead took place under\nmonarchs known to be powerful and effective as rulers go, we would be compelled to seek a new\ninterpretation of how and why modern budgeting evolved.\nKing John, forced to accept the Magna Carta, is often depicted as the most despised among all of\nEngland\u2019s many monarchs. Leaving aside the folklore of the Robin Hood stories, there are many episodes\nrelated to his relations with his father, Henry II, and brother, Richard I, both very colourful characters\nthemselves.72 Invariably they all paint \u201cBad King John\u201d or \u201cJohn Lackland\u201d in such unfavourable terms that\nit seems inevitable that the 25 barons would stand up to him and put their demands in writing that the king\nagree to restrain his behaviour. He met his end shortly in circumstances that were befittingly as ignoble as\nhis reign.\nJohn\u2019s successor, Henry III, was barely past his 9th birthday when he took the throne. Although his reign\nlasted 56 years, it was overshadowed by Simon de Montfort, who successfully led the baronial opposition\nand, as de facto ruler of the country, called the first representative parliament that included members\nbeyond the nobility in 1265,73 shortly before he was killed in battle later in the same year.\nThe only strong kings found in English budgeting history are Edward I and his grandson Edward III.74\nDespite his obvious authority, the first Edward appears to have found it more expedient to work together\nwith Parliament to facilitate delivery of the much-needed, frequently requested funds to finance the\ncontinual conflicts with the Welsh, Scots, and the French throughout his reign. The latter Edward is noted\nfor the two occasions (1348 and 1353) where he gave his verbal pledge not to use the granted taxes for\nany purpose other than the war with Scotland. Again, despite his popularity, Edward III may not have found\nhimself in very favourable circumstances. The continual conflict with France, known as the Hundred Years\u2019\nWar, had already placed the kingdom under enormous financial pressure against further taxes. It did not\nhelp, either, that an episode of Black Death broke out in 1348, eventually claiming the lives of a third or\npossibly more of the population.75\n24 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nThe most significant developments in budgeting, as previously described, took place in the 17th century.\nThis was the time of the House of Stuart, following the death of the last of the Tudors, Elizabeth I, in 1603.\nAlthough the Tudors, notably Henry VIII and Elizabeth, were perhaps the most powerful monarchs in\nEnglish history that Parliament dared not oppose,76 it was a different story altogether for the Stuarts\nthroughout their entire collective reign. The first Stuart, James I, came to the throne from a background\nthat did not inspire his subjects to the wholehearted trust they had given his predecessor. On his ascension\nto the English throne in 1603, James had already been King of Scotland since an infant in 1567, when his\nmother, Mary, Queen of Scots, had been forced to abdicate her throne. An uncomfortable rival to Elizabeth,\nMary was later executed on her cousin\u2019s order in 1587. James\u2019 Scottish origin, combined with his tolerance\nfor Catholics, may also have been a factor that affected his relationship with Parliament. Although his\npolitical skills allowed James to get by with Parliament, he was responsible for sowing two seeds that years\nafter his death led directly to the Civil War and execution of his son, Charles I. Despite, or perhaps instead\nmotivated by, his weaker hold over the nation than the Tudors, James espoused the divine right of kings,\na theological basis for absolute monarchy, and even wrote two books on his theory.77 Known for his\nchastity in his younger days, he later showed a marked preference for male company, particularly with his\nfavourite, George Villiers, later made the Duke of Buckingham. He thus left for his son Charles both the\nabsolutist idea of monarchy that would clash so violently with Parliament and the political pretext for\nParliament\u2019s opposition, the dismissal of the Duke. James was also known for profligacy and incompetence\nin his financial affairs, which did not predispose Parliament to regard Charles\u2019 request for taxes favourably\nfrom the very first session under the new king. Arguably more honourable than his father, Charles had a\npersonality that was rather inflexible and politically not adroit enough to avert the ultimate confrontation\nthat he would later face.\nUpon the Glorious Revolution, Parliament once and for all settled the question of sovereignty and the limits\non monarchy. This was done through the Coronation Oath Act of 1688 and the Bill of Rights of 1689.\nParliament then took the trouble to strengthen its own discipline by its 1706 resolution (later to become\nStanding Order 66), which prohibited any spending initiative by Commons. This happened during the reign\nof Anne, the last of the Stuart line, and not known as a strong monarch.\nAnne having left no issue despite her 17 pregnancies, the throne passed on to the House of Hanover. The\nCrown\u2019s influence declined again with this importing of a German line of relatives, particularly during the\nlater well-known long bouts of mental illness78 that incapacitated the third Hanover monarch, George III.\nMeanwhile, throughout the 18th century, the budget system continued to see a steady extension of its\nscope until it came to encompass even spending out of the royal household\u2019s own income, culminating\nwith the establishment of the Consolidated Fund in 1787.\nThe brief and informal review above does show a picture where key events in the evolution of budgeting\nmostly took place when the monarchy was not strong, allowing democratic principles and institutions to\ngradually gain ground against autocratic monarchy.\nWhy the English?\nThere remains one final question: \u201cWhy the English?\u201d The answer is known that the question has no real\nanswer, but having come this far in the search for the origin of budgeting, one cannot resist asking this\nultimate question.\nWe have already seen how budgeting began, evolved, and subsequently spread to all countries. But that\nstill leaves us asking the question, why did it start in England and not some other country? Can we identify\na particular reason, or did budgeting simply have to start somewhere and it just happened to be England?\nFor a state to exist, it must have a ruler, but in virtually all states throughout history, the very concept of a\nruler implied autocratic dominance, at least in theory and often in practice. The notion that there can be a\nsystem that presupposes a permanent entity with powers that can oppose the ruler is not intuitively obvious\nand even oxymoronic, since with that kind of power, one would naturally expect the leader of that alternate\n\uf07c 25\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\npotent entity to dominate and become the leader himself. Is there anything that explains why the English\nwere or became different from everyone else?\nThe simple answer is that the English had always been like that \u2013 not very willing to submit wholly to the\nruler and quick to object to unjust orders or objectionable behaviour by the king. In comparison to other\ncultures that adhered at least in theory to a model of top-down autocratic monarchy, England was much\nmore likely to develop a model of statehood that enabled checks and balances based on the existence of\nseparated powers.\nThis may not be a satisfactory answer to our question as it fails to point at a clear beginning occasion, but\nit does point to a different perspective worth exploring for some surprising insights. The above\ncharacterisation of the English is not really uniquely limited to them only; it is a common trait describing\nthe \u201cGermanic\u201d tribes. Upon first encountering a new group of people who shared a common culture some\ntwo thousand years ago, spread over Northwestern and Central Europe and Scandinavia, the Romans\npromptly dubbed them the \u201cGermanic\u201d peoples. Roman sources at the time noted that while individually\nformidable as warriors, the Germanic forces lacked the organisation and discipline to be effective, quite\nunlike the famed Roman legions. Another feature mentioned by the Romans was that these people made\nimportant decisions in a popular assembly, the \u00feing (thing), but they also had kings and war leaders, who\nwere often elected.79 To Roman eyes, these people appeared to be quite unruly, lacking tight organisation\nand discipline \u2013 in short, different enough in temperament to be incompatible with the Roman way of life.\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman empire, the Danish Angles and their southern neighbours, the Saxons,\nmigrated to England, taking the idea of the \u00feing with them to form the witenagemot (meeting of witans, or\nwise ones). This is the king\u2019s council in the Anglo-Saxon days of somewhat hazy ancient lore, often cited\nas the precursor to the English parliament. On top of this Anglo-Saxon institution, the opposite thinking of\nstrong autocracy was abruptly imposed by another strain of the Germanic peoples upon William of\nNormandy\u2019s conquest in 1066. Being frenchified former Vikings, the Normans came from Germanic origins,\nas did the subjugated Anglo-Saxons. But having taken the French or continental idea of autocratic\nleadership to heart, the Normans promptly forced it on their freshly conquered subjects. The stage was\nthus set for two competing, mutually incompatible ideas of statehood and leadership to intermittently clash\nwith each other over some six centuries. The continual conflict probably intensified the ideological\ncommitments on both sides, which was stirred up even further when the religious split initiated by Henry VIII\nraised the stakes. When things had built up to a critical point in the 1600s, the resolution saw England\nfinally giving the world the first parliamentary system of democratic government, along with the first budget\nsystem. Along the way, the uneasy cohabitation of Norman and Anglo-Saxon ways also produced the\ncommon law system as distinct from the continental civil law system, which can be traced back to Roman\nlaw, especially as thoroughly revamped by Justianian into his Corpus Juris Civilis.\nAs a final observation, the preceding two paragraphs begin and end with references to Rome, which\nprovokes one last speculation. Over a century ago, Weber (1905[13]) wrote that the Protestant ethic was\nwhat explained why certain countries embraced capitalism, allowing them to develop or modernise ahead\nof their Catholic neighbours. But this leaves the author wondering whether Weber may have missed the\nbigger picture: the Protestant-Catholic divide may perhaps be only one result in some larger picture, not\nthe cause as identified by his investigation limited to a narrower scope. After all, the centralised, disciplined\nRoman way of organising things tightly, taken in contrast with the looser, somewhat more unruly approach\nfavoured by the Germanic peoples, seems to actually \u201cexplain\u201d most of the important differences between\nthe two worlds for the next two millennia, even to the present day. The only difference from the ancient\ndays seems to be that over the two thousand intervening years, the \u201cGermanic barbarians\u201d at the periphery\nof the Empire appear to have pulled ahead of their Continental counterparts, perhaps thanks to their looser\nor \u201cfreer\u201d temperaments and systems, better suited to take advantage of market principles and\ndecentralised management but which in the old days had conversely placed them at a disadvantage.\n26 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nThe ancient geographic boundary between the Roman Empire and the territories of the Germanic peoples\nserves as a reliable guide throughout European history to the present day for sorting out physical areas or\ncountries that can be mapped to many dichotomies. These would include: liberal vs. centralised tendencies\nin political structures; rights of the individual vs. those of the state; common vs. civil legal systems;\nsubstance vs. form, or preferences for practical ex post results vs. ex ante legalistic completeness;\nProtestantism vs. Catholicism; flexible vs. rigid approaches (planning vs. plans); and innovators vs.\nfollowers in modern government and public sector reforms, e.g. for budgeting, performance, transparency\nand accountability, not to mention government accounting. As in Roman days, throughout history the\nGermans of today have tended to stand somewhere in between the two worlds, differently from their other\n\u201cGermanic\u201d kin.\nIt is straightforwardly obvious that this dichotomy was subsequently extended to other regions of the world\nthrough imperialistic conquests \u2013 how decisive such influence has been may vary, however, for individual\ncountries.80 In this context, we wish to point up the fact that this one last tangential speculation about the\nRoman vs. the Germanic cultures does have some bearing on the effort to understand the present\nuniversal dominance of the Western budgeting model. The origin of the Western budgeting model\n(revolutionary in many ways and not expected to evolve very naturally) is both the title and the main thesis\nof this paper, but the second thesis is also quite remarkable, that it came to enjoy a world-wide, universal\nprevalence in such a short period of historical time. The speculation offers the reader an opportunity to\ncontemplate this second thesis from a much broader perspective on history, politics, and cultures.\n\uf07c 27\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nReferences\nBalfour, M.

Contrary to Key\u2019s (1940[19]) interpretation, the more recent focus on achieving\nefficiency, results, or performance, remains an important, but secondary priority for the budget system.\n2 Being an important result of the legislature\u2019s vote, each annual budget is by itself regarded as a law in\nmost countries. To my knowledge the only exceptions are Japan, Korea, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,\nand the Chinese Taipei.\n3\nI hasten to add that I am under no illusion that adopting constitutions and laws that profess democratic\nseparation of powers will be sufficient to deliver or guarantee an actual democratic state. There can be,\nand probably is, much room for stated laws or policy to differ from the actual implementation, unfortunately\nsometimes intentionally or cynically so. Alternately, many countries still have not been able to develop the\n30 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nkind of resilient institutions necessary for robust democracy. See also the discussion on Asian and African\ncountries in the last part of Section 1.3.1 in this paper.\n4 The notable exceptions being some Greek city-states (e.g. Athens), and pre-Augustan Rome.\n5\ni.e. throughout the paper we ignore the sole alternative to the two cases \u2013 rule by one (monarchy) and\nby the many (democracy) \u2013 which would be the case of rule by a few (oligarchy). Note that the points\nconcerning monarchy in the paper would apply equally to oligarchies.\n6 For instance, the idea that the monarch could not impose taxes at will, but had to obtain the consent of\nthe realm, or the concept of appropriations as the final legal consent for the monarch\u2019s use of funds (which\nmay have been already agreed to by Parliament, but still needed to be formally appropriated for final\nrelease) were points that Parliament frequently brought up as established by \u201cancient\u201d customs or laws.\n7 One notes that this stretch of English history is certainly more than distractive enough to divert attention\naway from anything as mundane as budgeting, filled as it is with fascinating episodes and narratives woven\nby colourful characters, political intrigues, and grand historical events. These being well-known and\nrecounted in various forms in both popular and academic venues, we will suppress the temptation to foray\ninto further details.\n8 As already noted above, in Kim (forthcoming[20]), I show that virtually all countries\u2019 constitutions and\norganic budget laws in the world today dictate that the budgeting decision be made within this framework\nthat separates power, or authority, between the government and the legislature in the same manner.\n9 Willoughby, Willoughby and Lindsay (1917, pp. 34-35[1]).\n10 John did not sign the document, but rather affixed the royal seal to it.\n11 Stourm (1917, p. 10[8]), citing Macaulay\u2019s History of England, notes \u201cThat the King could not impose\ntaxes without the consent of Parliament is admitted to have been, from time immemorial, a fundamental\nlaw of England. It was among the articles which John was compelled by the Barons to sign. Edward I\nventured to break through the rule; but able, powerful and popular as he was, he encountered an opposition\nto which he found it expedient to yield. He covenanted accordingly in express terms, for himself and his\nheirs, that they would never again levy any aid without the assent and good-will of the estates of the realm.\u201d\n12 Scutage and aid can be taken as the medieval feudal term for taxes. The quoted provisions are English\ntranslations from the Latin original (Davis, 1963, pp. 23-33[42]).\n13 Willoughby, Willoughby and Lindsay (1917, p. 29[1]), citing Maitland (1908, p. 182[7]). Also see Krause\n(2015[22]) for how taxes financed the war expenses of Britain and Prussia as modern finance ministries\nevolved.\n14 Another long-standing custom was not to allow standing armies. Raising and sustaining forces to wage\nwarfare was therefore definitely not a part of the king\u2019s routine expenditures. There is a practical aspect to\nthe matter \u2013 as Krause shows, military expenses were typically several times larger than the king\u2019s\npeacetime expenses.\n15 \u2018Confirmed,\u2019 rather than \u2018gained\u2019 or \u2018created,\u2019 because the notion that taxation requires consent of the\nrealm or the people was already held by the English, from \u2018ancient tradition.\u2019 The Charter, however, was\nthe first instance where this was expressed and acknowledged by the monarch himself in writing.\n16 Complementing and mutually supporting the other elements crucial to securing a hold over the state:\nviolence (as identified by Weber (1919[15])), and authority over personnel decisions (appointments and\ndismissals).\n\uf07c 31\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\n17 See the final section of the paper. Uniquely to Germanic cultures, important decisions were made in a\npopular assembly called a \u201cthing,\u201d which in old Norse, English, and Dutch meant a meeting or assembly.\nTraces of this name can still be found in Nordic countries. A surviving example would be the Althingi\n(gathering between assemblies), Iceland\u2019s legislature founded in 930, one of the oldest parliaments in the\nworld. Similarly, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden all have legislatures whose names end in \u2018ting,\u2019 which\nmeans assembly or meeting. There is also the Sameting for the Sami people in northern Scandinavia.\nInterestingly, Germany is the exception, naming its legislature the Diet, which, however, also means\nmeeting (in addition to the usual usage in reference to food).\n18 Although it is mostly the Charter of 1215 that is commonly referred to (as this paper does) because of\nits iconic symbolic significance, it is the revised and reissued versions by Henry III (1216, 1217, and 1225)\nand Edward I (1297), typically renewed by each monarch thereafter, that effectively established the\nmedieval relationship between the monarch and his subjects (including the commoners) in England.\n19 Parliamentary History, Volume VI, (1763[9]).\n20 The French monarchy\u2019s depreciative attitude toward the legislature in matters of taxation and laws in\ngeneral was in marked contrast to the English right up to the French Revolution (See Section 1.3.2).\n21 For further details on Edward\u2019s administrative and legal reforms, see Burt (2012[17]), especially Ch. 8.\n22 As noted by Weber (1919[15]) even further several centuries later, the definition of the state dictates a\nmonopoly of power (violence). Locke\u2019s genius was to suggest that this seemingly monolithic power could\nbe separated and assigned to multiple, rather than a single, entities.\n23 From Maitland (p. 311[7]), the precedent was followed in some, but not all, other cases under Charles II,\nand not at all during the reign of James II. After the Revolution, it was invariably followed. Maitland also\nnotes that already under Charles II, the appropriation clause on limiting the purpose of spending was taken\nseriously enough to cause the impeachment of the king\u2019s treasurer, Lord Danby, in 1678.\n24 i.e. the \u201cways and means\u201d review, coming after the authorising decision, may find that the actual sum\nthat can be raised and spent may fall short of the authorised amount.\n25 This is particularly characteristic of the US budget system. Mandatory expenses (pensions, healthcare\nand the like) are usually authorised in one-time legislations, which set the key conditions and rates or\nformulas at which expenditures will take place. The annual expenditures will then be executed every year\naccording to this law, without a separate process at the legislature every year to appropriate the sums that\nwill be spent. In contrast, discretionary spending is appropriated every year by the legislature without a\nseparate authorisation act, which is deemed to be implicitly given with the appropriating decision \u2013\nappropriations in the US therefore usually means discretionary expenses only. Note that in the UK budget\nand in the Commonwealth countries, unlike the US budget the annual appropriation encompasses all\ngovernment spending, including the mandatory, automatic expenditures.\nOf course, the distinction between appropriations and authorisation is not as simple or clear as I have\nmade it out to be. For a more detailed account of how the issue developed in US budgeting history, see\nthe CRS report by Schick (1984[35]). Also see Fisher (1979[18]), Heniff (2012[44]; 2015[43]), and Saturno and\nYeh (2016[36]) for authorisation vs. appropriation in the US budget system.\n26 These finishing touches, however, would take a further sixty years up to the Glorious Revolution to\nsolidify, and then a further century to gradually extend the scope of the budget.\n27 The quoted excerpt is from Stourm (1917, p. 11[8]).\n32 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\n28 Appropriating larger amounts over longer periods would diminish Parliament\u2019s influence in relation to the\nCrown.\n29 See Schick (2002[14]), in his brief description of the English traditions that gave birth to budgeting.\n30 From his inauguration in 1625 to 1629, Charles holds to a similar pattern of dealing with Parliament\nunsuccessfully, where he ends up dissolving Parliament without having obtained his supplies.\n31 Already at the end of the 1625 Parliament, the first under Charles, The Parliamentary History notes that\n\u201cIt is plain that the Antipathy the Commons had then taken against the Prime Minister [the Duke], was the\nOccasion of their Slackness in granting Supplies, [\u2026]\u201d (Volume VI, (p. 405[9])). A later entry in the same\nsource, given after the king\u2019s reply to Commons quoted below, shows the animosity has peaked by the\nnext parliament: \u201cBut the Spirit raised against the Minister could not be conjured down by any thing the\nKing could do; and no Supply was to be expected, till the Duke was given up to public Vengeance. The\nCommons followed the Chace [sic] very warmly against him; and in some of their Debates, very severe\nExpressions were used against the Court; [\u2026]\u201d (Ibid. (p. 431[9])).\n32 This dichotomy between authorisation and appropriation is preserved very clearly and visibly in the\nbudget systems of India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, all of which had strong British influence. According to\ntheir constitutions, the budget proposal is reviewed and then approved by the legislature after any required\nadjustments, which corresponds to the authorisation. Immediately upon approval of the \u201cgrants\u201d in this\nmanner, a new bill is introduced, listing only the titles and amounts of the spending items without any\nfurther details, and promptly enacted without amendments.\n33 The usual historical interest on Charles\u2019 reign dwells primarily on political events that immediately follow\nthis, i.e. mainly the events after this period. Starting in 1629, this includes the eleven years without\nParliament (when he resorted to questionable tactics such as forced loans and ship money to raise funds)\nand the twenty years thereafter where we have the Short, Long, and Rump Parliaments (covering the\nperiod that saw the Civil War, Charles\u2019 execution, and the Interregnum). For budgeting, however, it is rather\nthe first several years of Charles\u2019 reign (1625 \u2013 1629) that demand our attention, when he was still\nattempting, however unsuccessfully, to work with Parliament.\n34 The relation between James I and the Duke went beyond being merely controversial and continually\nfuelled much salacious speculation. More information can be easily had with casual searches in popular\nmedia, so we will forgo further discussion in this paper, noting only that the anomalous closeness of the\nDuke\u2019s relation to the monarchs most likely did play a role in stoking Parliament\u2019s animosity toward him.\nDespite the strong and widespread antipathy from Commons and the people, the Duke remained at the\nheight of royal favour until he was assassinated in 1628 at the age of 35 by an army officer disgruntled at\nbeing passed over for promotion.\n35 Ship money refers to taxes granted to the king to collect from residents of ports and nearby locations to\nhelp with the upkeep of naval vessels, on the reasoning that their livelihoods benefitted from the presence\nand traffic of the ships. Charles, without any consent by Parliament, which he did not bother to convene\nfor over a decade after 1629, extended ship money to locations far inland, though they clearly had nothing\nto do with servicing or benefitting from ships. Forced loans are simply taxes imposed unilaterally by the\nking on citizens, but to avoid the legal problem of obtaining Parliament\u2019s consent, the king insisted on\ncalling them loans, not taxes. However, anyone who refused or was late in paying his \u201cloan\u201d assessed by\nthe king would still promptly end up in jail.\n36 Originally, some specific-purpose taxes were granted to the king for the entirety of his reign. However,\nto reinforce its influence over the royal palace, Parliament began requiring that these taxes be reapproved\n\uf07c 33\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\non a regular basis or, in most cases, annually. In the process, annuality became an essential budgetary\nprinciple.\n37 As opposed to the wages of public servants (the civil service), which is not charged to the Consolidated\nFund. Inclusion of judicial officials\u2019 wages is to protect their independence.\n38 As originally resolved in 1706 it reads, \u201cResolved, That this House will receive no Petition for any Sum\nof Money relating to public Service, but what is recommended from the Crown.\u201d\nAccording to the Standing Orders of the House of Commons (2016[33]) and the House of Commons Minutes\nof Proceedings, Volume 15, (p. 211[32]), the resolution was adopted on 11 December 1706. In 1702, Queen\nAnne had succeeded to the throne following William III and Mary II, whom Parliament had recognised as\nmonarchs after the Glorious Revolution, which had led to significant weakening of the royal power. The\nresolution was made a Standing Order (SO) in 1713 (Ibid., Volume 17, (p. 417[32])), a year before Anne\u2019s\ndeath in 1714, and revised four times. The key terms and purpose of the resolution remain unchanged,\nsave for some clarifying extensions. Unlike those of the House of Lords (2009[46]), the standing orders of\nCommons were originally not numbered. When Commons finally assigned numbers to the standing orders\nin 1884, the resolution came to be widely known as SO66. It was later redesignated as SO48 during a\nreorganisation of the Standing Orders of the House of Commons.\n39 Annuality, unity, universality, and specificity.\n40 As is the case with the United Kingdom, France and Germany also constitutionally prohibit parliament\nmembers from proposing any expenditure-incurring bills without the government\u2019s consent. The US has\nsimilar provisions in the Rules of the House of Representatives (2017[31]) and the Senate (2014[30]).\nHowever, the American provisions appear to be less effective in restricting increases or new initiatives\nintroduced by Congress. Most constitutional laws across the world similarly restrict budget increases\ninitiated by legislative bodies, albeit with differing degrees of strictness.\n41 HM Treasury\u2019s evolution may strike some readers as relevant to the query for budgeting\u2019s origins, as it\nis a government institution whose purpose is closely related to budgeting (or, more generally, to public\nfinance, as also including the revenue and fund management, besides the spending side). While fully\nacknowledging the importance of Treasury\u2019s role and history, I have elected to omit that story because it\nappears to fall outside the scope of this paper \u2013 very little is directly relevant to the discussion presented\nhere regarding how budgeting started and developed. The story of HM Treasury, important as it is, deals\nwith issues that are more detailed but concerned with lower-level topics within government as budgeting\nand management of the state\u2019s finances evolved, not the broader issues between the monarchic and\npopular sovereignty (i.e. the monarch vs. the legislature), which is the ultimate issue at stake that drove\nthe creation of a framework for decision-making in spending. Readers still interested in Treasury may wish\nto consult Roseveare (1973[37]) or Baxter (1957[41]) for further information.\nSimilarly, some readers may find that the references to the political background and events provided here,\nwhile certainly adequate for history aficionados, may be too terse. I have restrained the impulse to follow\nthe political or historical stories since they are not the main subject of inquiry, however interesting or even\nfascinating they may be (and usually are). However, the \u201calerts\u201d strewn through the narration should\nprovide the reader with adequate starting references for information that can be easily had through general\nqueries even in popular media, if not more serious academic material. In contrast, the main sources I have\nrelied on (Willoughby, Willoughby and Lindsay, 1917[1]; Maitland, 1908[7]; Stourm, 1917[8]) provide very little\nbackground context, probably because most readers are presumed to be already quite familiar with the\nrelated political and historical developments.\n34 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\n42 As noted at the beginning of this paper, virtually all countries\u2019 constitutions and organic budget laws in\nthe world today subscribe to the same model of power relations in budgeting.\n43 Admittedly, autocracies may still have constitutions, but this is not absolutely required, since they may\ninstead proclaim a code of laws or a basic law on the ruler\u2019s authority. In contrast, democratic separation\nof powers must be axiomatically established by a constitution.\n44 Excluding those of ancient times, such as Athens, which had a written constitution.\n45 Louis XVI still had two years before he went to the guillotine in 1793, which also happens to be the year\nthat the second French constitution was adopted.\n46 Article 10 of the same section further recognised the king\u2019s civil list, whose expenses will be paid for by\nthe nation for \u201cthe magnificence of the throne.\u201d\n47 The word \u201cbudget,\u201d which began to be used by the English in the mid-1700s, was disdained as vulgar\nby the French and not fit for official use until the early 1800s. Among the cited constitutions that I have\nbeen able to examine in detail, \u201cbudget\u201d appears in the 1831 Belgian constitution, in Article 115. The Dutch\nconstitution also required that the parliament approve the budget, consisting of a fixed and an extraordinary\npart, the latter for the army. A similar requirement appears in the Portuguese constitution (\u201cor\u00e7amentos,\u201d\nArticle 224).\n48 Germany did not exist yet. Representing the German people, but never quite capable of functioning as\na state, the Holy Roman Empire had stood as a loosely integrated union of small Germanic states and\nprincipalities for close to a thousand years, from 962 to 1806. Prussia united the German states to form\nthe German Empire in 1871.\n49 Introducing a Western-style constitution was the crowning piece of Japan\u2019s urgent mission to modernise\nso as to be able to stand on equal footing with their Western counterparts, after having their shores forced\nopen to Commodore Perry\u2019s gunboat diplomacy in 1853. See Takii (2007[45]) for a complete translation of\nthe Meiji Constitution.\n50 See Siemes (1962[26]; 1968[27]), Suzuki Yasuzo and Johannes Siemes (1941[21]; 1941[24]; 1942[25]).\n51 See Kunitake (2009[38]), Ito (1904[40]), or Pittau (1965[23]) for Japanese thinking at the time.\n52 Ito (1889[39]).\n53 Taft (1912[34]). The appendix has responses to a questionnaire on national budget systems from\n39 countries, which gives a snapshot of budgeting in virtually all sovereign countries in the world ca. 1910.\n54 See Schick\u2019s CRS report (1984[35]) for details.\n55 Even now, all countries accord the legislative initiative to both the legislature and the government,\nexcepting only the US and the Philippines.\n56 This is the current practice. In the past, the bill originated in the House of Representatives.\n57 Lacking the authorisation to spend without a budget, the US government must literally shutdown as a\nconsequence of its veto, which usually brings more pressure on the government than Congress. Other\ncountries do not share this problem. All other presidential systems grant the power of partial (line-item)\nvetoes to the president (Kim, forthcoming[20]). Countries with cabinet systems in the British style have the\nvote on account, which grants lump-sum authorisation to the government that allows it to continue spending\nfor previously approved purposes until the budget is finalised. The Korean president, too, has only the full\nveto, but the budget is not a law and therefore not subject to a veto of any kind in the first place.\n\uf07c 35\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\n58 In not a few countries, the form of constitution and government was not entirely left up to the newly\nindependent nation to decide, but had non-trivial influence from the former imperial master. We will not\npursue this angle any further, as such interventions will hardly impact the discussion at hand.\n59 I present evidence for this in a separate paper after reviewing over 130 countries\u2019 current constitutions\n(Kim, forthcoming[20]).\n60 See the third paragraph of the Introduction.\n61 See Kim (forthcoming[20]).\n62 Note that besides the Asian and African countries of interest for this section, we can also point to other\n\u201clatecomers\u201d to nation-building during an earlier period. Prussia, Meiji Japan, the Soviet Union under Stalin,\nand Nazi Germany are also examples where the fa\u00e7ade of separated powers (i.e. having the legislature\nand government as separate top-level entities of the state) was maintained, but in substance, checks-and\u0002balances were rendered inoperative. Top-down nation-building decisions unencumbered by the legislature\nwere clearly the main role of budgeting in this scheme, yet that was not important enough to eliminate the\nlegislature altogether, but only bypass it while keeping up the appearance of a democratic framework with\nostensibly separated powers.\n63 In this sense, information we can observe about whether the budgeting decision framework conforms to\nseparation of powers is orthogonal to information on the motivation for adopting the Western budgeting\nmodel (democracy or planning efficiency?) \u2013 in a mathematical analogy, the former \u201cvariable\u201d has only one\nobserved value and therefore cannot be used to predict the second variable (the motivation for adopting\nthe Western model of the state and the budget system).\n64 Explicit consideration of the different possible motivations for adopting the Western model of budgeting\ndoes, however, enrich our understanding of that model. This and related issues are further elaborated on\nin Kim (forthcoming[20]).\n65 Although many similar sources can be easily found on the etymological origins of \u201cbudget,\u201d the blog\nentry by Paul Seaward (2012[28]) appears to have the most detailed, fullest account. Also see Balfour (1866,\npp. 3-4[16]). Note as well that Robert Walpole\u2019s pamphlet is publicly available in scanned form at the Internet\nArchive, https://archive.org.\n66 In a report to the Tribunat in Year XI of the French Revolution.\n67 The exact year is given as 1803 by Balfour (1866, p. 4[16]), who quotes Marquis d\u2019Audiffret, former\nPresident of the Court of Auditors and widely regarded as having \u201cfounded the modern science of public\nfinances in France,\u201d as saying, \u201c\u2026 only appeared for the first time, in the Acts of the French Government,\nin the Decrees of the Consuls in the interval between the months of August, 1802, and the month of April,\n1803, in which this term budget replaced the former estimate of receipts and expenditure.\u201d\n68 Note that this was already about a century later than Simon de Montfort\u2019s representative English\nParliament of 1265.\n69 Stourm, especially in Part I of his book, discusses how key concepts such as the \u201cperiod\u201d (fiscal vs.\nadministrative; i.e. the finer points of annuality), universality, and comprehensiveness of the budget\nunderwent extensive refinement, thanks mainly to Baron Louis.\n70 Webber and Wildavsky (1986, p. 327[29]) summarise the French budget system\u2019s improvements and\ninfluence on its neighbours as follows: \u201cIn ten years, between 1817 and 1827, France enacted a series of\nlaws establishing centralized management of taxing and spending, [\u2026] Belgium, building its budgetary\nstructures of the French model after its own revolution in 1830, soon developed segmented financial\n36 \uf07c\nOECD JOURNAL ON BUDGETING, VOLUME 2024, ISSUE 1 \u00a9 OECD 2024\nmanagement. [\u2026] The Netherlands established centralized structures for legislative control of spending\nafter 1848; Italy, in 1860; Sweden, after 1876; Norway, in 1905; Denmark, in 1915. In general, these\nchanges occurred after radical changes in the structure of government.\u201d\n71 French budgeting history, perhaps extended to cover the royal finances in the ancient regime days,\nincluding treatment of national finances by Quesnay and the Physiocrats, certainly deserves a much more\nextensive discussion than the brief review presented in this section. But that would be a task for a separate\npaper or probably at least an entire book. For us, the section may be considered too brief, but it is\nnevertheless sufficient to help answer our \u201csimple\u201d question decisively: where did budgeting originate, and\nhow?\n72 As was Henry\u2019s queen, Eleanor of Aquitaine, mother to Richard and John. Richard\u2019s encounters with\nSaladin are also a legendary part of the Crusades lore.\n73 Prior to that, he was also central to the 1258 Parliament\u2019s developing the Provisions of Oxford, a key\nconstitutional reform that was similar in spirit to the earlier Magna Carta. The king\u2019s refusal to honour the\nProvisions sparked off the baronial opposition known as the Second Baron\u2019s War.\n74 Edward III may have enjoyed greater popularity among his subjects simply by having replaced his rather\nunpopular father, Edward II, rumoured to have met an end in a manner that is slyly reminiscent of his\n\u201cunconventional\u201d conduct during his reign, quite bizarre even for English history,\n75 The final major outbreak of the Black Death occurred in 1665, or when Charles II was similarly asked by\nParliament to state the purpose of the funds requested for warfare against the Netherlands, but this time,\nin writing, instead of verbally as Edward III had done.\n76 However, Parliament assiduously legislated after-the-fact laws to keep them congruent with the\ndecisions made by the Tudor monarchs without Parliament\u2019s consent. This was used effectively against\nlater monarchs to tell them that decisions and policy may not differ from what the law said. The tables were\nnow turned, and any new ideas the monarch might wish for could now be implemented only by new or\namended laws to that effect, the passage of which required the consent of Parliament.\n77 The True Law of Free Monarchies and Basilikon Doron (Royal Gift).\n78 During one of which the American colonies were lost.\n79 This custom survived into the Electoral College of the Holy Roman Empire, where the prince electors\ngathered to vote for the next Emperor.\n80 Kim (forthcoming[20]) surveys how individual countries have adopted the Western model with what kinds\nof modifications.\nFrom:\nOECD Journal on Budgeting\nAccess the journal at:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1787/16812336\nPlease cite this article as:\nKim, John M.

Here we present MedSAM, a foundation model designed\nfor bridging this gap by enabling universal medical image segmentation. The\nmodel is developed on a large-scale medical image dataset with 1,570,263\nimage-mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities and over 30 cancer types.\nWe conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 86 internal validation tasks and 60\nexternal validation tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness than\nmodality-wise specialist models. By delivering accurate and efficient seg\u0002mentation across a wide spectrum of tasks, MedSAM holds significant\npotential to expedite the evolution of diagnostic tools and the personalization\nof treatment plans.\nSegmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging analysis, which\ninvolves identifying and delineating regions of interest (ROI) in various\nmedical images, such as organs, lesions, and tissues1\n. Accurate seg\u0002mentation is essential for many clinical applications, including disease\ndiagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of disease\nprogression2,3\n. Manual segmentation has long been the gold standard\nfor delineating anatomical structures and pathological regions, but\nthis process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often requires a\nhigh degree of expertise. Semi- or fully automatic segmentation\nmethods can significantly reduce the time and labor required, increase\nconsistency, and enable the analysis of large-scale datasets4\n.\nDeep learning-based models have shown great promise in medical\nimage segmentation due to their ability to learn intricate image fea\u0002tures and deliver accurate segmentation results across a diverse range\nof tasks, from segmenting specific anatomical structures to identifying\npathological regions5\n. However, a significant limitation of many cur\u0002rent medical image segmentation models is their task-specific nature.\nThese models are typically designed and trained for a specific seg\u0002mentation task, and their performance can degrade significantly when\napplied to new tasks or different types of imaging data6\n. This lack of\ngenerality poses a substantial obstacle to the wider application of\nthese models in clinical practice. In contrast, recent advances in the\nfield of natural image segmentation have witnessed the emergence of\nsegmentation foundation models, such as segment anything model\n(SAM)7 and Segment Everything Everywhere with Multi-modal\nprompts all at once8\n, showcasing remarkable versatility and perfor\u0002mance across various segmentation tasks.\nThere is a growing demand for universal models in medical image\nsegmentation: models that can be trained once and then applied to a\nwide range of segmentation tasks. Such models would not only exhibit\nheightened versatility in terms of model capacity but also potentially\nlead to more consistent results across different tasks. However, the\napplicability of the segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM7\n) to\nmedical image segmentation remains limited due to the significant\ndifferences between natural images and medical images. Essentially,\nSAM is a promptable segmentation method that requires points or\nbounding boxes to specify the segmentation targets. This resembles\nconventional interactive segmentation methods4,9\u201311 but SAM has bet\u0002ter generalization ability, while existing deep learning-based inter\u0002active segmentation methods focus mainly on limited tasks and image\nmodalities.\nMany studies have applied the out-of-the-box SAM models to\ntypical medical image segmentation tasks12\u201317 and other challenging\nscenarios18\u201321. For example, the concurrent studies22,23 conducted a\nReceived: 24 October 2023\nAccepted: 5 January 2024\nCheck for updates\n1\nPeter Munk Cardiac Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada. 2Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto,\nToronto, ON, Canada. 3\nVector Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada. 4Department of Computer Science, Western University, London, ON, Canada. 5Tandon School\nof Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, USA. 6\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. 7Department of\nComputer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. 8\nUHN AI Hub, Toronto, ON, Canada. e-mail: bowang@vectorinstitute.ai\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 1\n1234567890():,;1234567890():,;\ncomprehensive assessment of SAM across a diverse array of medical\nimages, underscoring that SAM achieved satisfactory segmentation\noutcomes primarily on targets characterized by distinct boundaries.\nHowever, the model exhibited substantial limitations in segmenting\ntypical medical targets with weak boundaries or low contrast. In con\u0002gruence with these observations, we further introduce MedSAM, a\nrefined foundation model that significantly enhances the segmenta\u0002tion performance of SAM on medical images. MedSAM accomplishes\nthis by fine-tuning SAM on an unprecedented dataset with more than\none million medical image-mask pairs.\nWe thoroughly evaluate MedSAM through comprehensive\nexperiments on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation\ntasks, spanning a variety of anatomical structures, pathological con\u0002ditions, and medical imaging modalities. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MedSAM consistently outperforms the state-of-the\u0002art (SOTA) segmentation foundation model7\n, while achieving perfor\u0002mance on par with, or even surpassing specialist models1,24 that were\ntrained on the images from the same modality. These results highlight\nthe potential of MedSAM as a new paradigm for versatile medical\nimage segmentation.\nResults\nMedSAM: a foundation model for promptable medical image\nsegmentation\nMedSAM aims to fulfill the role of a foundation model for universal\nmedical image segmentation. A crucial aspect of constructing such a\nmodel is the capacity to accommodate a wide range of variations in\nimaging conditions, anatomical structures, and pathological condi\u0002tions. To address this challenge, we curated a diverse and large-scale\nmedical image segmentation dataset with 1,570,263 medical image\u0002mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities, over 30 cancer types, and\na multitude of imaging protocols (Fig. 1 and Supplementary\nTables 1\u20134). This large-scale dataset allows MedSAM to learn a rich\nrepresentation of medical images, capturing a broad spectrum of\nanatomies and lesions across different modalities. Figure 2a provides\nan overview of the distribution of images across different medical\nimaging modalities in the dataset, ranked by their total numbers. It is\nevident that computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance ima\u0002ging (MRI), and endoscopy are the dominant modalities, reflecting\ntheir ubiquity in clinical practice. CT and MRI images provide detailed\ncross-sectional views of 3D body structures, making them indis\u0002pensable for non-invasive diagnostic imaging. Endoscopy, albeit more\ninvasive, enables direct visual inspection of organ interiors, proving\ninvaluable for diagnosing gastrointestinal and urological conditions.\nDespite the prevalence of these modalities, others such as ultrasound,\npathology, fundus, dermoscopy, mammography, and optical coher\u0002ence tomography (OCT) also hold significant roles in clinical practice.\nThe diversity of these modalities and their corresponding segmenta\u0002tion targets underscores the necessity for universal and effective\nsegmentation models capable of handling the unique characteristics\nassociated with each modality.\nAnother critical consideration is the selection of the appropriate\nsegmentation prompt and network architecture. While the concept of\nfully automatic segmentation foundation models is enticing, it is\nfraught with challenges that make it impractical. One of the primary\nchallenges is the variability inherent in segmentation tasks. For\nexample, given a liver cancer CT image, the segmentation task can vary\ndepending on the specific clinical scenario. One clinician might be\nFig. 1 | MedSAM is trained on a large-scale dataset that can handle diverse segmentation tasks. The dataset covers a variety of anatomical structures, pathological\nconditions, and medical imaging modalities. The magenta contours and mask overlays denote the expert annotations and MedSAM segmentation results, respectively.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 2\ninterested in segmenting the liver tumor, while another might need to\nsegment the entire liver and surrounding organs. Additionally, the\nvariability in imaging modalities presents another challenge. Mod\u0002alities such as CT and MR generate 3D images, whereas others like\nX-ray and ultrasound yield 2D images. These variabilities in task defi\u0002nition and imaging modalities complicate the design of a fully auto\u0002matic model capable of accurately anticipating and addressing the\ndiverse requirements of different users.\nConsidering these challenges, we argue that a more practical\napproach is to develop a promptable 2D segmentation model. The\nmodel can be easily adapted to specific tasks based on user-provided\nprompts, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability. It is also able\nto handle both 2D and 3D images by processing 3D images as a series\nof 2D slices. Typical user prompts include points and bounding boxes\nand we show some segmentation examples with the different prompts\nin Supplementary Fig. 1. It can be found that bounding boxes provide a\nmore unambiguous spatial context for the region of interest, enabling\nthe algorithm to more precisely discern the target area. This stands in\ncontrast to point-based prompts, which can introduce ambiguity,\nparticularly when proximate structures resemble each other. More\u0002over, drawing a bounding box is efficient, especially in scenarios\ninvolving multi-object segmentation. We follow the network archi\u0002tecture in SAM7\n, including an image encoder, a prompt encoder, and a\nmask decoder (Fig. 2b). The image encoder25 maps the input image\ninto a high-dimensional image embedding space. The prompt encoder\ntransforms the user-drawn bounding boxes into feature representa\u0002tions via positional encoding26. Finally, the mask decoder fuses the\nimage embedding and prompt features using cross-attention27\n(Methods).\nQuantitative and qualitative analysis\nWe evaluated MedSAM through both internal validation and external\nvalidation. Specifically, we compared it to the SOTA segmentation\nfoundation model SAM7 as well as modality-wise specialist U-Net1 and\nDeepLabV3+24 models. Each specialized model was trained on images\nfrom the corresponding modality, resulting in 10 dedicated specialist\nmodels for each method. During inference, these specialist models\nwere used to segment the images from corresponding modalities,\nwhile SAM and MedSAM were employed for segmenting images across\nall modalities (Methods). The internal validation contained 86 seg\u0002mentation tasks (Supplementary Tables 5\u20138 and Fig. 2), and Fig. 3a\nshows the median dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score of these tasks\nfor the four methods. Overall, SAM obtained the lowest performance\non most segmentation tasks although it performed promisingly on\nsome RGB image segmentation tasks, such as polyp (DSC: 91.3%,\ninterquartile range (IQR): 81.2\u201395.1%) segmentation in endoscopy\nimages. This could be attributed to SAM\u2019s training on a variety of RGB\nimages, and the fact that many targets in these images are relatively\nstraightforward to segment due to their distinct appearances. The\nother three models outperformed SAM by a large margin and MedSAM\nhas a narrower distribution of DSC scores of the 86 interval validation\ntasks than the two groups of specialist models, reflecting the robust\u0002ness of MedSAM across different tasks. We further connected the DSC\nscores corresponding to the same task of the four models with the\npodium plot Fig. 3b, which is complementary to the box plot. In the\nupper part, each colored dot denotes the median DSC achieved with\nthe respective method on one task. Dots corresponding to identical\ntest cases are connected by a line. In the lower part, the frequency of\nachieved ranks for each method is presented with bar charts. It can be\nfound that MedSAM ranked in first place on most tasks, surpassing the\nperformance of the U-Net and DeepLabV3+ specialist models that have\na high frequency of ranks with second and third places, respectively, In\ncontrast, SAM ranked last place in almost all tasks. Figure 3c (and\nSupplementary Fig. 9) visualizes some randomly selected segmenta\u0002tion examples where MedSAM obtained a median DSC score, including\nliver tumor in CT images, brain tumor in MR images, breast tumor in\nultrasound images, and polyp in endoscopy images. SAM struggles\nwith targets of weak boundaries, which is prone to under or over\u0002segmentation errors. In contrast, MedSAM can accurately segment a\nwide range of targets across various imaging conditions, which\nachieves comparable of even better than the specialist U-Net and\nDeepLabV3+ models.\nThe external validation included 60 segmentation tasks, all of\nwhich either were from new datasets or involved unseen segmen\u0002tation targets (Supplementary Tables 9\u201311 and Figs. 10\u201312). Fig\u0002ure 4a, b show the task-wise median DSC score distribution and their\ncorrespondence of the 60 tasks, respectively. Although SAM con\u0002tinued exhibiting lower performance on most CT and MR segmen\u0002tation tasks, the specialist models no longer consistently\noutperformed SAM (e.g., right kidney segmentation in MR T1-\nweighted images: 90.1%, 85.3%, 86.4% for SAM, U-Net, and Dee\u0002pLabV3+, respectively). This indicates the limited generalization\nability of such specialist models on unseen targets. In contrast,\nMedSAM consistently delivers superior performance. For example,\nMedSAM obtained median DSC scores of 87.8% (IQR: 85.0-91.4%) on\nthe nasopharynx cancer segmentation task, demonstrating 52.3%,\n15.5%, and 22.7 improvements over SAM, the specialist U-Net, and\nDeepLabV3+, respectively. Significantly, MedSAM also achieved\nbetter performance in some unseen modalities (e.g., abdomen T1\nInphase and Outphase), surpassing SAM and the specialist models\nwith improvements by up to 10%. Figure 4c presents four randomly\nselected segmentation examples for qualitative evaluation, reveal\u0002ing that while all the methods have the ability to handle simple\nsegmentation targets, MedSAM performs better at segmenting\nchallenging targets with indistinguishable boundaries, such as cer\u0002vical cancer in MR images (more examples are presented in Sup\u0002plementary Fig. 13). Furthermore, we evaluated MedSAM on the\nmultiple myeloma plasma cell dataset, which represents a distinct\nmodality and task in contrast to all previously leveraged validation\ntasks. Although this task had never been seen during training,\na b\nImage\nencoder\nBounding box prompts\nMask decoder\nPrompt encoder\nInput Image Segmentation\nImage\nembedding\nFig. 2 | Overview of the modality distribution in the dataset and the network architecture. a The number of medical image-mask pairs in each modality. b MedSAM is a\npromptable segmentation method where users can use bounding boxes to specify the segmentation targets.

We additionally trained MedSAM on\ntwo different dataset sizes: 10,000 (10K) and 100,000 (100K) images\nand their performances were compared with the default MedSAM\nmodel. The 10K and 100K training images were uniformly sampled\nfrom the whole training set, to maintain data diversity. As shown in\n(Fig. 5a) (Supplementary Tables 12\u201314), the performance adhered to\nthe scaling rule, where increasing the number of training images sig\u0002nificantly improved the performance in both internal and external\nvalidation sets.\nMedSAM can improve the annotation efficiency\nFurthermore, we conducted a human annotation study to assess the\ntime cost of two pipelines (Methods). For the first pipeline, two human\nexperts manually annotate 3D adrenal tumors in a slice-by-slice way. For\nthe second pipeline, the experts first drew the long and short tumor axes\nwith the linear marker (initial marker) every 3-10 slices, which is a com\u0002mon practice in tumor response evaluation. Then, MedSAM was used to\nsegment the tumors based on these sparse linear annotations. Finally,\nthe expert manually revised the segmentation results until they were\nsatisfied. We quantitatively compared the annotation time cost between\nthe two pipelines (Fig. 5b). The results demonstrate that with the assis\u0002tance of MedSAM, the annotation time is substantially reduced by\n82.37% and 82.95% for the two experts, respectively.\nDiscussion\nWe introduce MedSAM, a deep learning-powered foundation model\ndesigned for the segmentation of a wide array of anatomical structures\nand lesions across diverse medical imaging modalities. MedSAM is\ntrained on a meticulously assembled large-scale dataset comprised of\nover one million medical image-mask pairs. Its promptable config\u0002uration strikes an optimal balance between automation and customi\u0002zation, rendering MedSAM a versatile tool for universal medical image\nsegmentation.\nThrough comprehensive evaluations encompassing both internal\nand external validation, MedSAM has demonstrated substantial cap\u0002abilities in segmenting a diverse array of targets and robust general\u0002ization abilities to manage new data and tasks. Its performance not\nonly significantly exceeds that of existing the state-of-the-art seg\u0002mentation foundation model, but also rivals or even surpasses spe\u0002cialist models. By providing precise delineation of anatomical\nstructures and pathological regions, MedSAM facilitates the compu\u0002tation of various quantitative measures that serve as biomarkers. For\ninstance, in the field of oncology, MedSAM could play a crucial role in\naccelerating the 3D tumor annotation process, enabling subsequent\ncalculations of tumor volume, which is a critical biomarker29 for\nassessing disease progression and response to treatment. Additionally,\nMedSAM provides a successful paradigm for adapting natural image\nfoundation models to new domains, which can be further extended to\nbiological image segmentation30, such as cell segmentation in light\nmicroscopy images31 and organelle segmentation in electron micro\u0002scopy images32.\nWhile MedSAM boasts strong capabilities, it does present certain\nlimitations. One such limitation is the modality imbalance in the\ntraining set, with CT, MRI, and endoscopy images dominating the\ndataset. This could potentially impact the model\u2019s performance on\nless-represented modalities, such as mammography. Another limita\u0002tion is its difficulty in the segmentation of vessel-like branching\nstructures because the bounding box prompt can be ambiguous in this\nsetting. For example, arteries and veins share the same bounding box\nin eye fundus images. However, these limitations do not diminish\nMedSAM\u2019s utility. Since MedSAM has learned rich and representative\nmedical image features from the large-scale training set, it can be fine\u0002tuned to effectively segment new tasks from less-represented mod\u0002alities or intricate structures like vessels.\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the feasibility of constructing a\nsingle foundation model capable of managing a multitude of seg\u0002mentation tasks, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific models.\nMedSAM, as the inaugural foundation model in medical image seg\u0002mentation, holds great potential to accelerate the advancement of new\ndiagnostic and therapeutic tools, and ultimately contribute to\nimproved patient care33.\nMethods\nDataset curation and pre-processing\nWe curated a comprehensive dataset by collating images from publicly\navailable medical image segmentation datasets, which were obtained\nfrom various sources across the internet, including the Cancer Imaging\nArchive (TCIA)34, Kaggle, Grand-Challenge, Scientific Data, CodaLab,\nand segmentation challenges in the Medical Image Computing and\nComputer Assisted Intervention Society (MICCAI). All the datasets\nprovided segmentation annotations by human experts, which have\nbeen widely used in existing literature (Supplementary Table 1\u20134). We\nincorporated these annotations directly for both model development\nand validation.\nThe original 3D datasets consisted of computed tomography (CT)\nand magnetic resonance (MR) images in DICOM, nrrd, or mhd formats.\nTo ensure uniformity and compatibility with developing medical\nimage deep learning models, we converted the images to the widely\nused NifTI format. Additionally, grayscale images (such as X-Ray and\nUltrasound) as well as RGB images (including endoscopy, dermoscopy,\nfundus, and pathology images), were converted to the png format.\nFig. 5 | The effect of training dataset size and a user study of tumor annotation\nefficiency. a Scaling up the training image size to one million can significantly\nimprove the model performance on both internal and external validation sets.\nb MedSAM can be used to substantially reduce the annotation time cost. Source\ndata are provided as a Source Data file.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 5\nSeveral exclusive criteria are applied to improve the dataset quality\nand consistency, including incomplete images and segmentation tar\u0002gets with branching structures, inaccurate annotations, and tiny\nvolumes. Notably, image intensities varied significantly across differ\u0002ent modalities. For instance, CT images had intensity values ranging\nfrom -2000 to 2000, while MR images exhibited a range of 0 to 3000.\nIn endoscopy and ultrasound images, intensity values typically span\u0002ned from 0 to 255. To facilitate stable training, we performed intensity\nnormalization across all images, ensuring they shared the same\nintensity range.\nFor CT images, we initially normalized the Hounsfield units using\ntypical window width and level values. The employed window width\nand level values for soft tissues, lung, and brain are (W:400, L:40),\n(W:1500, L:-160), and (W:80, L:40), respectively. Subsequently, the\nintensity values were rescaled to the range of [0, 255]. For MR, X-ray,\nultrasound, mammography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT)\nimages, we clipped the intensity values to the range between the 0.5th\nand 99.5th percentiles before rescaling them to the range of [0, 255].\nRegarding RGB images (e.g., endoscopy, dermoscopy, fundus, and\npathology images), if they were already within the expected intensity\nrange of [0, 255], their intensities remained unchanged. However, if\nthey fell outside this range, we utilized max-min normalization to\nrescale the intensity values to [0, 255]. Finally, to meet the model\u2019s\ninput requirements, all images were resized to a uniform size of\n1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3. In the case of whole-slide pathology images, patches\nwere extracted using a sliding window approach without overlaps. The\npatches located on boundaries were padded to this size with 0. As for\n3D CT and MR images, each 2D slice was resized to 1024 \u00d7 1024, and\nthe channel was repeated three times to maintain consistency. The\nremaining 2D images were directly resized to 1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3. Bi-cubic\ninterpolation was used for resizing images, while nearest-neighbor\ninterpolation was applied for resizing masks to preserve their precise\nboundaries and avoid introducing unwanted artifacts. These standar\u0002dization procedures ensured uniformity and compatibility across all\nimages and facilitated seamless integration into the subsequent stages\nof the model training and evaluation pipeline.\nNetwork architecture\nThe network utilized in this study was built on transformer\narchitecture27, which has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in\nvarious domains such as natural language processing and image\nrecognition tasks25. Specifically, the network incorporated a vision\ntransformer (ViT)-based image encoder responsible for extracting\nimage features, a prompt encoder for integrating user interactions\n(bounding boxes), and a mask decoder that generated segmentation\nresults and confidence scores using the image embedding, prompt\nembedding, and output token.\nTo strike a balance between segmentation performance and com\u0002putational efficiency, we employed the base ViT model as the image\nencoder since extensive evaluation indicated that larger ViT models,\nsuch as ViT Large and ViT Huge, offered only marginal improvements in\naccuracy7 while significantly increasing computational demands. Speci\u0002fically, the base ViT model consists of 12 transformer layers27, with each\nblock comprising a multi-head self-attention block and a Multilayer\nPerceptron (MLP) block incorporating layer normalization35. Pre-training\nwas performed using masked auto-encoder modeling36, followed by\nfully supervised training on the SAM dataset7\n. The input image\n(1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3) was reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D patches\nwith the size 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 3, yielding a feature size in image embedding of\n64 \u00d7 64 after passing through the image encoder, which is 16 \u00d7 down\u0002scaled. The prompt encoders mapped the corner point of the bounding\nbox prompt to 256-dimensional vectorial embeddings26. In particular,\neach bounding box was represented by an embedding pair of the top\u0002left corner point and the bottom-right corner point. To facilitate real\u0002time user interactions once the image embedding had been computed, a\nlightweight mask decoder architecture was employed. It consists of two\ntransformer layers27 for fusing the image embedding and prompt\nencoding, and two transposed convolutional layers to enhance the\nembedding resolution to 256 \u00d7 256. Subsequently, the embedding\nunderwent sigmoid activation, followed by bi-linear interpolations to\nmatch the input size.\nTraining protocol and experimental setting\nDuring data pre-processing, we obtained 1,570,263 medical image\u0002mask pairs for model development and validation. For internal vali\u0002dation, we randomly split the dataset into 80%, 10%, and 10% as\ntraining, tuning, and validation, respectively. Specifically, for mod\u0002alities where within-scan continuity exists, such as CT and MRI, and\nmodalities where continuity exists between consecutive frames, we\nperformed the data splitting at the 3D scan and the video level\nrespectively, by which any potential data leak was prevented. For\npathology images, recognizing the significance of slide-level cohe\u0002siveness, we first separated the whole-slide images into distinct slide\u0002based sets. Then, each slide was divided into small patches with a fixed\nsize of 1024 \u00d7 1024. This setup allowed us to monitor the model\u2019s\nperformance on the tuning set and adjust its parameters during\ntraining to prevent overfitting. For the external validation, all datasets\nwere held out and did not appear during model training. These data\u0002sets provide a stringent test of the model\u2019s generalization ability, as\nthey represent new patients, imaging conditions, and potentially new\nsegmentation tasks that the model has not encountered before. By\nevaluating the performance of MedSAM on these unseen datasets, we\ncan gain a realistic understanding of how MedSAM is likely to perform\nin real-world clinical settings, where it will need to handle a wide range\nof variability and unpredictability in the data. The training and vali\u0002dation are independent.\nThe model was initialized with the pre-trained SAM model with\nthe ViT-Base model. We fixed the prompt encoder since it can already\nencode the bounding box prompt. All the trainable parameters in the\nimage encoder and mask decoder were updated during training.\nSpecifically, the number of trainable parameters for the image encoder\nand mask decoder are 89,670,912 and 4,058,340, respectively. The\nbounding box prompt was simulated from the expert annotations with\na random perturbation of 0-20 pixels. The loss function is the\nunweighted sum between dice loss and cross-entropy loss, which has\nbeen proven to be robust in various segmentation tasks1\n. The network\nwas optimized by AdamW37 optimizer (\u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999) with an\ninitial learning rate of 1e-4 and a weight decay of 0.01. The global batch\nsize was 160 and data augmentation was not used. The model was\ntrained on 20 A100 (80G) GPUs with 150 epochs and the last check\u0002point was selected as the final model.\nFurthermore, to thoroughly evaluate the performance of Med\u0002SAM, we conducted comparative analyses against both the state-of\u0002the-art segmentation foundation model SAM7 and specialist models\n(i.e., U-Net1 and DeepLabV3+24). The training images contained 10\nmodalities: CT, MR, chest X-ray (CXR), dermoscopy, endoscopy,\nultrasound, mammography, OCT, and pathology, and we trained the\nU-Net and DeepLabV3+ specialist models for each modality. There\nwere 20 specialist models in total and the number of corresponding\ntraining images was presented in Supplementary Table 5. We\nemployed the nnU-Net to conduct all U-Net experiments, which can\nautomatically configure the network architecture based on the dataset\nproperties. In order to incorporate the bounding box prompt into the\nmodel, we transformed the bounding box into a binary mask and\nconcatenated it with the image as the model input. This function was\noriginally supported by nnU-Net in the cascaded pipeline, which has\ndemonstrated increased performance in many segmentation tasks by\nusing the binary mask as an additional channel to specify the target\nlocation. The training settings followed the default configurations of\n2D nnU-Net. Each model was trained on one A100 GPU with 1000\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 6\nepochs and the last checkpoint was used as the final model. The\nDeepLabV3+ specialist models used ResNet5038 as the encoder. Similar\nto ref. 3, the input images were resized to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3. The bounding\nbox was transformed into a binary mask as an additional input channel\nto provide the object location prompt. Segmentation Models Pytorch\n(0.3.3)39 was used to perform training and inference for all the\nmodality-wise specialist DeepLabV3 + models. Each modality-wise\nmodel was trained on one A100 GPU with 500 epochs and the last\ncheckpoint was used as the final model. During the inference phase,\nSAM and MedSAM were used to perform segmentation across all\nmodalities with a single model. In contrast, the U-Net and DeepLabV3+\nspecialist models were used to individually segment the respective\ncorresponding modalities.\nA task-specific segmentation model might outperform a modality\u0002based one for certain applications. Since U-Net obtained better per\u0002formance than DeepLabV3+ on most tasks, we further conducted a\ncomparison study by training task-specific U-Net models on four\nrepresentative tasks, including liver cancer segmentation in CT scans,\nabdominal organ segmentation in MR scans, nerve cancer segmenta\u0002tion in ultrasound, and polyp segmentation in endoscopy images. The\nexperiments included both internal validation and external validation.\nFor internal validation, we adhered to the default data splits, using\nthem to train the task-specific U-Net models and then evaluate their\nperformance on the corresponding validation set. For external vali\u0002dation, the trained U-Net models were evaluated on new datasets from\nthe same modality or segmentation targets. In all these experiments,\nMedSAM was directly applied to the validation sets without additional\nfine-tuning. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 15, while task-specific U\u0002Net models often achieved great results on internal validation sets,\ntheir performance diminished significantly for external sets. In con\u0002trast, MedSAM maintained consistent performance across both inter\u0002nal and external validation sets. This underscores MedSAM\u2019s superior\ngeneralization ability, making it a versatile tool in a variety of medical\nimage segmentation tasks.\nLoss function\nWe used the unweighted sum between cross-entropy loss and dice\nloss40 as the final loss function since it has been proven to be robust\nacross different medical image segmentation tasks41. Specifically, let\nS, G denote the segmentation result and ground truth, respectively.\nsi, gi denotes the predicted segmentation and ground truth of voxel i,\nrespectively. N is the number of voxels in the image I. Binary cross\u0002entropy loss is defined by\nLBCE = \u0001 1\nN\nXN\ni = 1\ngi log si + \u00f01 \u0001 gi\u00de log\u00f01 \u0001 si\u00de \u0002 \u0003, \u00f01\u00de\nand dice loss is defined by\nLDice = 1 \u0001 2\nPN\ni = 1 gisi PN\ni = 1 \u00f0gi\u00de\n2 + PN\ni = 1 \u00f0si\u00de\n2 : \u00f02\u00de\nThe final loss L is defined by\nL = LBCE + LDice: \u00f03\u00de\nHuman annotation study\nThe objective of the human annotation study was to quantitatively\nevaluate how MedSAM can reduce the annotation time cost. Specifi\u0002cally, we used the recent adrenocortical carcinoma CT dataset34,42,43,\nwhere the segmentation target, adrenal tumor, was neither part of the\ntraining nor of the existing validation sets. We randomly sampled 10\ncases, comprising a total of 733 tumor slices requiring annotations.\nTwo human experts participated in this study, both of whom are\nexperienced radiologists with 8 and 6 years of clinical practice in\nabdominal diseases, respectively. Each expert generated two groups of\nannotations, one with the assistance of MedSAM and one without.\nIn the first group, the experts manually annotated the 3D adrenal\ntumor in a slice-by-slice manner. Annotations by the two experts were\nconducted independently, with no collaborative discussions, and the\ntime taken for each case was recorded. In the second group, annota\u0002tions were generated after one week of cooling period. The experts\nindependently drew the long and short tumor axes as initial markers,\nwhich is a common practice in tumor response evaluation. This pro\u0002cess was executed every 3-10 slices from the top slice to the bottom\nslice of the tumor. Then, we applied MedSAM to segment the tumors\nbased on these sparse linear annotations, including three steps.\n\u2022 Step 1. For each annotated slice, a rectangle binary mask was\ngenerated based on the linear label that can completely cover\nthe linear label. \u2022 Step 2. For the unlabeled slices, the rectangle binary masks were\ncreated through interpolation of the surrounding labeled slices. \u2022 Step 3. We transformed the binary masks into bounding boxes\nand then fed them along with the images into MedSAM to gen\u0002erate segmentation results.\nAll these steps were conducted in an automatic way and the model\nrunning time was recorded for each case. Finally, human experts\nmanually refined the segmentation results until they met their satis\u0002faction. To summarize, the time cost of the second group of annota\u0002tions contained three parts: initial markers, MedSAM inference, and\nrefinement. All the manual annotation processes were based on ITK\u0002SNAP44, an open-source software designed for medical image visuali\u0002zation and annotation.\nEvaluation metrics\nWe followed the recommendations in Metrics Reloaded45 and used the\ndice similarity coefficient and normalized surface distance (NSD) to\nquantitatively evaluate the segmentation results. DSC is a region-based\nsegmentation metric, aiming to evaluate the region overlap between\nexpert annotation masks and segmentation results, which is defined by\nDSC\u00f0G, S\u00de = 2jG \\ Sj\njGj + jSj\n,\nNSD46 is a boundary-based metric, aiming to evaluate the boundary\nconsensus between expert annotation masks and segmentation results\nat a given tolerance, which is defined by\nNSD\u00f0G, S\u00de = j\u2202G \\ B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\n\u2202S j + j\u2202S \\ B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u2202Gj\nj\u2202Gj + j\u2202Sj ,\nwhere B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\n\u2202G = fx 2 R3 j 9x~ 2 \u2202G, jjx \u0001 x~jj \u2264 \u03c4g, B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u2202S = fx 2 R3 j 9x~ 2 \u2202S, jjx \u0001\nx~jj \u2264 \u03c4g denote the border region of the expert annotation mask and\nthe segmentation surface at tolerance \u03c4, respectively. In this paper, we\nset the tolerance \u03c4 as 2.\nStatistical analysis\nTo statistically analyze and compare the performance of the afore\u0002mentioned four methods (MedSAM, SAM, U-Net, and DeepLabV3+\nspecialist models), we employed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. This\nnon-parametric test is well-suited for comparing paired samples and is\nparticularly useful when the data does not meet the assumptions of\nnormal distribution. This analysis allowed us to determine if any\nmethod demonstrated statistically superior segmentation perfor\u0002mance compared to the others, providing valuable insights into the\ncomparative effectiveness of the evaluated methods. The Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test results are marked on the DSC and NSD score tables\n(Supplementary Table 6\u201311).\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 7\nSoftware utilized\nAll code was implemented in Python (3.10) using Pytorch (2.0) as the\nbase deep learning framework.

Supplier Relationship\nManagement (SRM) is widely recognized as a crucial method for achieving this goal, as\nevidenced by numerous studies conducted in well-established industrial settings, such as the\nUnited States (Farooque et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021) and Germany (Reu et al., 2019). These\nstudies, conducted on a worldwide scale, have highlighted the positive influence of proficient SRM\nstrategies on various aspects of supply chain performance, including supplier performance, cost\neffectiveness, product quality, and delivery punctuality. As global industries continue to evolve,\nemerging economies like Bangladesh have become prominent participants in the international\nmarketplace.\nIn the specific context of Bangladesh, a country experiencing rapid economic growth and a\nflourishing industrial sector, the significance of efficient SRM cannot be emphasized enough. In\nrecent years, Bangladesh has demonstrated significant progress in establishing itself as a\nprominent participant in the worldwide supply chain, with a particular focus on industries such\ntextiles, ready-made clothing, and electronics (Fouji & Hoque, 2021). Due to its expanding industrial\nsector and extensive supplier network, the nation has emerged as an appealing destination for\nforeign enterprises in search of economically efficient manufacturing and sourcing alternatives. The\nobserved evolution serves as evidence of Bangladesh's capacity inside the international\nmarketplace. Nevertheless, it is crucial to examine the impact of SRM techniques on the\nperformance of supply chains functioning in Bangladesh, as the country takes on its position in the\nglobal supply chain. Although there exists a considerable body of literature on SRM, a significant\nproportion of the study has mostly concentrated on industrialized economies. Consequently, there\nis a notable knowledge gap about the application and effectiveness of SRM in emerging economies\nsuch as Bangladesh. The distinctive environment of Bangladesh, characterized by its economic,\ncultural, and infrastructural intricacies, warrants a focused examination (Hossain et al., 2023).\nThe primary objective of the present study is to fill the existing research void by quantitatively\nexamining the impact of SRM on enhancing supply chain performance in the context of Bangladesh.\nThis investigation will build upon the knowledge gained from prior research conducted on a\nworldwide scale. For instance, research conducted in the United States by Farooque et al., (2022)\nand in Germany by Reu\u00df et al., (2019) emphasized the favorable influence of proficient SRM\nstrategies on various aspects, including supplier performance, cost effectiveness, product quality,\nand delivery punctuality. The conducted research, carried out in established industrial contexts,\nhas yielded significant reference points for SRM procedures. Nevertheless, the specific economic,\ncultural, and infrastructural complexities of Bangladesh give rise to a separate framework that\ncould potentially impact the dynamics of SRM in a distinct manner. The current study seeks to fill\nthis void by particularly examining the Bangladeshi context, so adding a nuanced viewpoint to the\nexisting pool of information. Through the analysis of SRM in an emerging country, this study aims\nto reveal unique perspectives that may diverge from findings in research undertaken in\nindustrialized countries. A comprehensive comprehension of how SRM methods affect\nperformance metrics is essential due to the unique difficulties and possibilities present in the\nsupply chain ecosystem of Bangladesh. The study offers a fresh viewpoint by examining the\nutilization and efficacy of SRM in a distinctive and ever-changing economic environment, providing\nvaluable insights that might enhance both theoretical understanding and practical implementation\nin the worldwide domain of supply chain management. Although several studies have investigated\nthe concept of SRM in developed economies, there is a notable scarcity of study that focuses on\nexamining this phenomenon within the unique context of Bangladesh. Prior studies conducted in\nthis domain have yielded significant findings pertaining to the correlations between SRM methods\nand key performance indicators (KPIs) within supply chain management. For example, research\ndone in the United States (Farooque et al., 2019) and Germany (Reu\u00df et al., 2019) has emphasized\nthe favorable influence of proficient SRM strategies on supplier performance, cost effectiveness,\nproduct quality, and delivery punctuality. The studies highlight the significance of SRM in improving\nmany facets of supply chain performance. Moreover, scholarly investigations conducted in\ndeveloping nations, such as India, have provided evidence of the significance of SRM strategies in\nenhancing cost effectiveness (Queiroz & Wamba, 2019). Numerous studies undertaken in various\ninternational settings have continuously underscored the significance of collaboration, information\nsharing, and trust-building between buyers and suppliers as pivotal elements of effective SRM\n(Hoang et al., 2023).\nAs Bangladesh strives to establish itself as a significant participant in the global supply chain, it\nis imperative to thoroughly investigate the suitability and efficacy of SRM approaches in this distinct\nsetting, as shown by previous study findings. Therefore, the present study aims to expand upon\nthe existing body of research by directing its attention towards the supply chains of Bangladesh.\nThis study seeks to give significant insights for practitioners and policymakers acting within the\nBangladeshi context by examining the correlation between SRM techniques and key supply chain\nperformance indicators, including Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n3/18\nEvaluation and Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships.\nPrevious research has provided valuable insights into the impact of SRM on supply chain\nperformance at a global level. However, this study seeks to expand this knowledge by examining\nthe specific context of Bangladesh. By doing so, it aims to contribute to a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of how SRM influences supply chain dynamics in emerging economies. Despite the\nincreasing significance of SRM, there exists a dearth of empirical studies examining its influence on\nsupply chain performance within the context of Bangladesh. The objective of this study is to\naddress the existing research gap by investigating the precise connections between SRM methods\nand measures of supply chain performance. The value of this study is derived from its contribution\nto the existing body of knowledge on SRM specifically within the setting of Bangladesh. It\ncontributes to the understanding of the advantages that may be gained by implementing successful\nSRM tactics. The primary objective of this study is to examine the manufacturing and service sectors\nin Bangladesh. The research will span enterprises of diverse sizes and operational complexities in\norder to conduct a thorough evaluation of SRM techniques and their influence on the performance\nof supply chains.\n2 EMPIRICAL LITERATURE AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT\n2.1 Supplier relationship management and supply chain performance\nSRM is a critical aspect of modern supply chain management (Adesanya et al., 2020). It involves\ndeveloping dynamic partnerships between businesses and their suppliers (Sharma et al., 2020).\nSRM focuses on creating lasting and mutually beneficial relationships beyond mere transactions\n(Enz & Lambert, 2023). In today's competitive landscape, strong supplier relationships are vital for\nsuccess (Amoako-Gyampah et al., 2019). SRM goes beyond transactions, encompassing strategic\ncollaboration, innovation, and value generation (Pereira et al., 2022). This review examines SRM's\nimpact on supply chain performance, including cost efficiency, product quality, on-time delivery,\nand customer satisfaction. SRM has evolved from transactional interactions to strategic alliances\n(Abbas & Tong, 2023). Recognizing suppliers as essential partners shifted the focus to collaboration\nand long-term partnerships. Technological advancements improved SRM's efficiency, with digital\nplatforms enhancing communication (Emon & Nahid, 2023; Tseng, 2020). Strong relationships with\nsuppliers stimulate innovation and value creation (Lee & Tang, 2018). SRM now encompasses\ncollaborative partnerships, risk management, supplier development, and sustainability (Emon &\nKhan, 2023; Huma et al., 2020). Empirical studies show that proficient SRM positively impacts\nsupplier performance, cost-effectiveness, product quality, and delivery punctuality (Le Jr, 2022).\nCollaboration, information exchange, and trust development are key foundations of successful\nSRM (Cha & Kim, 2018). Supplier development activities enhance supplier performance (Mani et al.,\n2018).\n2.2 Supplier Collaboration and Supply Chain Performance:\nSRM highlights the importance of strategic collaboration as a fundamental element for\nachieving success in the current dynamic and competitive supply chain environment (Oduro et al.,\n2020). There is a large body of literature that strongly supports the notion that successful\ncollaboration with suppliers plays a crucial role in improving the performance of the supply chain.\nThis section examines the current studies on how supplier collaboration affects several aspects of\nsupply chain performance and builds upon the literature presented by Oduro et al., (2020).\nCollaborative relationships in SRM go beyond standard transactional methods and play a crucial\nrole in promoting innovation, enhancing product quality, assuring timely delivery, and ultimately\nimproving customer happiness (Abtahi et al., 2023; Stek & Schiele, 2021). The development of SRM\nhas experienced a significant change from transactional interactions to the formation of strategic\npartnerships, emphasizing the crucial role of collaboration in creating and sustaining long-term\nrelationships with suppliers (Yang, 2022). The growing interdependence and global integration of\nsupply chains has underscored the importance of strong collaborative methods. Technological\nimprovements are crucial in enabling and enhancing collaborative efforts in SRM. Digital platforms\nhave become crucial instruments that not only facilitate communication but also improve the\nsharing of information between organizations and their suppliers (Ebinger & Omondi, 2020). These\nplatforms facilitate instantaneous data exchange, which is essential for efficient collaboration,\nespecially in a multinational supply chain setting where prompt information is vital.\nAlthough (Leiras & Fontainha, 2019; Oduro et al., 2020) have shed light on the beneficial effects\nof supplier collaboration on supply chain performance, there may still be gaps and unexplored\nareas in the existing literature. The purpose of this part is to identify the gaps in the current\nunderstanding of how supplier collaboration affects supply chain performance. It also highlights\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n4/18\nthe specific contributions of this study in addressing and enhancing the existing knowledge in this\narea. This study seeks to further the knowledge of the complex relationship between collaborative\npractices and supply chain performance by combining additional literature that addresses subtle\naspects of supplier collaboration.\n2.3 Supplier Development and Supply Chain Performance\nSupplier development activities are acknowledged as key elements in the larger context of SRM,\nserving a vital function in improving supplier performance and, subsequently, overall supply chain\nefficiency (Dubey et al., 2019). This part performs a thorough examination of the current body of\nresearch to investigate the complex connection between supplier development and supply chain\nperformance, expanding upon the knowledge presented by Dubey et al., (2019). Supplier\ndevelopment goes beyond conventional transactional methods and encompasses a range of\nactions aimed at improving the talents and performance of suppliers (Awan et al., 2019). Activities\nmay encompass training programs, streamlining processes, embracing technology, and engaging\nin collaborative projects with the goal of promoting innovation and ongoing enhancement.\nAccording to the literature, supplier development programs that are successful contribute to better\nsupplier performance, which in turn leads to cost-effectiveness and increased efficiency in the\nsupply chain (Asif et al., 2022).\nAlthough the current body of literature offers significant insights into the favorable relationship\nbetween supplier development and supply chain performance, there are still intricacies and unique\nmechanisms that warrant further investigation. Gaining insight into the impact of different\nelements of supplier development on various facets of supply chain performance is essential for\nformulating focused and efficient strategies. This section seeks to highlight any existing gaps in the\ncurrent knowledge and clarify how the present study helps to filling these gaps by offering a\ndetailed perspective on the complex connection between supplier development activities and the\noverall performance of the supply chain.\n2.4 Supplier Evaluation and Supply Chain Performance:\nEffective SRM relies on the use of strong supplier assessment methods, which are essential for\nachieving optimal supply chain efficiency (Amoako-Gyampah et al., 2019; Klingebiel et al., 2013).\nThis section provides a comprehensive analysis of the current research on the complex connection\nbetween supplier evaluation and the overall performance of the supply chain. It expands on the\nfundamental findings presented by Amoako-Gyampah et al., (2019). Supplier evaluation in the\ncontext of SRM entails a thorough examination of supplier performance, cost efficiency, product\nquality, and delivery timeliness (Lim et al., 2021). Proficient SRM has been found to have a favorable\nimpact on supplier evaluation, leading to improvements in several aspects of supply chain\nperformance, as indicated by the existing literature. However, there may be gaps in our present\nunderstanding of how the precise criteria used in supplier assessment processes are closely\nconnected to various aspects of supply chain performance. The purpose of this section is to identify\nand explain the gaps in the current knowledge, by conducting a detailed analysis of the relationship\nbetween different criteria used to evaluate suppliers and various aspects of supply chain\nperformance. Through this approach, it aims to enhance and improve the theoretical foundation\nthat supports the connection between supplier evaluation methods and the overall efficacy of the\nsupply chain.\n2.5 Long-Term Supplier Relationship and Supply Chain Performance:\nLong-term supplier connections play a crucial role in SRM, exerting substantial impact on supply\nchain performance (Oduro et al., 2020). This part provides a thorough examination of the current\nresearch, exploring the complex connection between long-term relationships with suppliers and\nthe various factors that affect supply chain effectiveness. The fundamental knowledge presented\nby Shakeel et al., (2018) acts as a crucial basis for this investigation. Organizations have recognized\nthe importance of suppliers as crucial partners and have therefore made it a strategic priority to\ndevelop long-term relationships. This involves focusing on collaboration and mutual benefits under\nthe SRM framework (Kannan, 2018). Empirical research confirm that long-term supplier\nrelationships have a beneficial effect on different measures of supply chain performance. However,\nthere may be gaps in our current understanding regarding the detailed mechanisms by which these\nlinkages contribute to the complex fabric of supply chain performance. This section aims to\nthoroughly identify any potential gaps in the current literature, with the goal of clarifying how the\npresent study enhances the understanding of the relationship between long-term supplier\nrelationships and various aspects of supply chain performance. In order to improve the scope and\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n5/18\ncomprehensiveness of this analysis, it will be crucial to include contemporary research and a variety\nof viewpoints on long-term supplier partnerships. This section aims to add to both theoretical\nrefinement and practical insights for businesses managing long-term supplier relationships within\nthe broader framework of SRM.\n2.6 Theoretical Frameworks in SRM\nUnderstanding Supplier Relationship Management's (SRM) theoretical foundations and\nevolution is essential to grasp its dynamics. Originally transactional, SRM has evolved into a\nstrategic approach focusing on long-term value (Dash et al., 2018). Theoretical dimensions include\ntransaction cost minimization, resource leverage, incentive alignment, and risk management (Rejeb\net al., 2021). The evolution of Transaction Cost Economics (TCE), Resource-Based View (RBV), and\nAgency Theory has mirrored SRM's transformation. Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) emphasizes\nminimizing transaction costs in SRM (Swallehe, 2021). Resource-Based View (RBV) highlights\nsupplier relationships as sources of competitive advantage (Andersen, 2021). Agency Theory\naddresses agency issues within supplier relationships (Dubey et al., 2019). These theories intersect\nin SRM to reduce costs, leverage resources, align incentives, and manage risks (Gilmore & Buhaug,\n2021).\nDepending upon the theoretical underpinnings elucidated in the comprehensive examination\nof existing literature, the present section delineates the conceptual framework that will guide the\ninvestigation. The theoretical framework selected for this study is the Resource-Based View (RBV),\nwhich asserts that businesses can attain enduring competitive advantage via the strategic\nutilization of distinctive resources and skills. across the scope of this study, the Resource-Based\nView (RBV) framework offers a perspective that enables the examination of how SRM methods\nimpact a particular outcome variable, namely cost efficiency, across supply chains operating in\nBangladesh. The Resource-Based View (RBV) theory places significant emphasis on the significance\nof supplier relationships as important sources of resources and capabilities that ultimately promote\ncost effectiveness within supply chains. The resources and capabilities obtained through SRM\ntechniques are anticipated to have a favorable impact on cost efficiency. This is demonstrated by\nthe potential to attain cost reductions, cost savings, and cost-effectiveness in supply chain activities.\n2.7 Research Hypotheses & Conceptual Framework\nSupplier collaboration: The implementation of supplier collaboration, which involves engaging\nin cooperative activities and sharing knowledge with suppliers, has been demonstrated to improve\nTable 1 - Theoretical Frameworks in SRM\nTheoretical\nFramework\nKey Concepts and Relevance Sources\nTransaction Cost\nEconomics\n- Minimizing transaction costs in\nsupplier relationships.\n(Rindfleisch, 2020; Schmidt &\nWagner, 2019; Stone, 1986)\n- Aligning SRM practices with\ntransaction-specific\ncharacteristics.\n(Macher & Richman, 2008; Saad\net al., 2022; Wynstra et al., 2019)\nResource-Based\nView\n- Leveraging supplier\nrelationships as sources of\ncompetitive advantage.\n(Barney, 1991; Nandi et al., 2020;\nShibin et al., 2020)\n- Recognizing supplier-specific\nassets, knowledge, and\ncapabilities.\n(Burki et al., 2023; Saghiri &\nMirzabeiki, 2021; Wernerfelt,\n1984)\nAgency Theory - Addressing agency problems\nand information asymmetry in\nSRM.\n(Dong et al., 2021; Jensen &\nMeckling, 2019; Kummer et al.,\n2020)\n- Designing SRM practices to align\nincentives between organizations\nand suppliers.\n(Ali et al., 2020; Dubey et al.,\n2019; Eisenhardt, 1989)\n- Monitoring and control\nmechanisms in SRM\nrelationships.\n(Fama, 1980; Songsom et al.,\n2019)\n- The role of contracts and\nperformance-based incentives in\nSRM.\n(Grum et al., 2023; Milgrom et al.,\n1992)\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n6/18\nthe operational efficiency of supply chain processes. Collaboration of this nature has the potential\nto enhance communication, optimize procedures, and enhance coordination, hence yielding cost\nefficiencies. Prior studies have provided evidence that the establishment of successful\ncollaboration with suppliers has a beneficial influence on cost efficiency (Cole & Aitken, 2019;\nPaparoidamis et al., 2019), thus confirming the premise of a positive association.\nH0: Supplier collaboration has no significant influence on cost efficiency in the supply chains of\nBangladeshi organizations.\nH1: Supplier collaboration has a significant positive influence on cost efficiency in the supply\nchains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nSupplier development: Supplier development programs, encompassing activities such as\ntraining and knowledge transfer, possess the capacity to augment the capabilities of suppliers,\nhence resulting in enhancements to processes and reductions in costs. Previous studies have\ndemonstrated that supplier development initiatives have a favorable impact on cost effectiveness\n(Awan et al., 2019; Sikombe & Phiri, 2019), hence substantiating the proposition of a positive\ncorrelation.\nH0: Supplier development efforts have no significant impact on cost efficiency in the supply\nchains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nH2: Supplier development efforts have a significant positive impact on cost efficiency in the\nsupply chains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nSupplier Evaluation and Selection: The implementation of effective supplier evaluation and\nselection methods is crucial in ensuring that organizations establish partnerships with dependable\nand high-performing suppliers. Efficient evaluation procedures are anticipated to result in\nimproved selection of suppliers, hence positively influencing cost effectiveness through the\nmitigation of quality-related concerns and supply disruptions. The favorable association between\nsupplier evaluation and selection and cost efficiency has been supported by empirical research\nconducted by Kannan (2018) and Naghshineh & Carvalho (2022) (Kannan, 2018; Naghshineh &\nCarvalho, 2022).\nH0: Effective supplier evaluation and selection practices have no significant effect on cost\nefficiency in the supply chains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nH3: Effective supplier evaluation and selection practices have a significant positive effect on cost\nefficiency in the supply chains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nLong-Term Supplier Relationships: The establishment and maintenance of enduring\nconnections with essential suppliers contribute to the cultivation of trust, collaboration, and shared\ncomprehension. These attributes are frequently linked with enhanced operational efficiency and\nless interruptions, hence contributing to cost-effectiveness. Prior studies have demonstrated that\nestablishing enduring partnerships with suppliers has a favorable impact on cost effectiveness\n(Herczeg et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2023), hence lending weight to the proposition of a positive\nassociation.\nH0: Long-term supplier relationships have no significant impact on cost efficiency in the supply\nchains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nH4: Long-term supplier relationships have a significant positive impact on cost efficiency in the\nsupply chains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nThe conceptual framework includes SRM practices as independent variables and supply chain\nperformance indicators (cost efficiency) as dependent variables. As illustrated in Figure 1 the four\nindependent variables namely Supplier collaboration, Supplier development, Supplier Evaluation\nand Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships have been presented in the left side of the\ndiagram and dependent variable cost efficiency is presented in the Right side of the diagram. The\nrelationships between each independent variable and the dependent variable are indicated by the\nfour-research hypothesis connecting the variables through the arrows.\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n7/18\nFigure 1 - Conceptual Framework\n3. MATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe research design employed for this study is quantitative, aiming to comprehensively\ninvestigate the relationship between SRM practices and cost efficiency in the supply chains of firms\noperating in Bangladesh. The study focuses on one main category of variables: independent\nvariables representing SRM practices and one dependent variable representing cost efficiency. In\nterms of independent variables, the study encompasses four dimensions of SRM practices. Supplier\nCollaboration, the variable in question quantifies the extent of collaboration and information\nexchange between enterprises and their suppliers. This statement elucidates the degree to which\nfirms partake in collaborative endeavors and exchange information with suppliers in order to\nenhance cost effectiveness within their supply chains (Tai et al., 2022). Supplier Development, this\nvariable evaluates the endeavors undertaken by enterprises to enhance the capabilities and\nresources of their suppliers. The initiatives encompass many strategies, such as training programs,\ntechnology transfer endeavors, and collaborative projects focused on enhancing process efficiency\nwith the goal of attaining cost effectiveness (Gu et al., 2021). Supplier Evaluation and Selection, this\nvariable investigates the criteria and procedures employed by firms to assess, choose, and oversee\ntheir suppliers. The concept incorporates various elements such as assessments of supplier\nperformance, evaluations of quality, and procedures related to risk management, all of which have\nan impact on cost efficiency (Dobos & V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, 2019). Long-Term Supplier Relationships, this\ncharacteristic pertains to the temporal extent and steadfastness of the associations established\nbetween organizations and their suppliers. The metric assesses the degree to which firms sustain\nenduring collaborations with crucial suppliers, which can have a lasting impact on cost effectiveness\n(Mohan et al., 2021). The dependent variable, Cost Efficiency, the dependent variable in question\nmeasures the degree of cost-effectiveness exhibited by supply chain operations. The\nmeasurements encompassed in this category consist of cost reduction, cost savings, and supply\nchain cost-to-revenue ratios (Panfilova et al., 2020). The study's setting was Bangladesh, with a\nspecific focus on organizations in various sectors, including manufacturing and services. The study\ninvolved a Convenience sampling technique to ensure representation from both manufacturing\nand service sectors. Data were collected from multiple departments or individuals responsible for\nSRM and supply chain operations within each firm, such as procurement, supply chain\nmanagement, and strategic management. The participants, selected based on their roles and\nresponsibilities related to SRM practices, included managers, procurement officers, and individuals\ninvolved in supply chain decision-making processes. A sample size of 270 individuals was\ndetermined to strike a balance between practicality and the requirement for statistical significance,\nconsidering the constraints of convenience sampling. Data were collected through a structured\nsurvey instrument consisting of 22 items, representing independent and dependent variables. The\nLikert scale was used to measure responses, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The\nsurvey instrument was developed based on a thorough review of existing literature and validated\nscales used in previous studies. Quantitative techniques, including regression analysis and\ncorrelation analysis, were applied for data analysis using SPSS 22 to assess the relationships\nbetween SRM practices and cost efficiency. These statistical methods aimed to provide insights into\nthe extent to which SRM practices influenced cost efficiency in the context of Bangladeshi firms.\nThroughout the research process, ethical considerations, including informed consent, data\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n8/18\nconfidentiality, and anonymity, were meticulously maintained to ensure the integrity and ethical\nconduct of the study. The reliability of the measurements was assessed through techniques such\nas Cronbach's alpha for survey instruments. The study aimed to minimize measurement errors and\nensure the reliability of collected data.\nTable 2 - Reliability of the Measurements\nConstruct Item No Cronbach\u2019s alpha\nSupplier Collaboration 5 .911\nSupplier Development 5 .922\nSupplier Evaluation and Selection 5 .876\nLong Term Supplier\nRelationships\n5 .917\nCost Efficiency 2 .854\nThe reliability of the measurements was assessed through Cronbach\u2019s alpha values for each\nconstruct in Table 2. The results indicate high internal consistency and reliability among the items\nmeasuring Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Long-Term Supplier Relationships, and\nCost Efficiency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha values of .911, .922, .917, and .854, respectively. The\nconstruct of Supplier Evaluation and Selection also exhibits good internal consistency, with a\nCronbach\u2019s alpha value of .876. These findings affirm the dependability of the measurement\ninstruments, suggesting that the items within each construct consistently capture the intended\nconcepts. Overall, the study's measurement instruments demonstrate satisfactory to excellent\nreliability, instilling confidence in the accuracy and consistency of the data collected for the\ninvestigation.\n4.

Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).\nThe results of the correlation study, as shown in Table 6, indicate statistically significant\nassociations among the variables being examined, namely \"Supplier Collaboration,\" \"Supplier\nDevelopment,\" \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection,\" \"Long Term Supplier Relationships,\" and \"Cost\nEfficiency.\" The quantification of these interactions is accomplished by use Pearson correlation\ncoefficients, all of which exhibit statistical significance at the 0.01 level (two-tailed), so suggesting\nrobust associations.\nThe dimension of \"Supplier Collaboration\" demonstrates a notably strong positive correlation\nof 88.9% with the dimension of \"Supplier Development,\" indicating a solid and significant\nassociation between these two aspects of managing supplier relationships. Furthermore, the\nconcept of \"Supplier Collaboration\" exhibits a significant positive correlation of 85.6% with\n\"Supplier Evaluation and Selection,\" underscoring the robustness of the association between these\ntwo factors. The concept of \"Supplier Development\" exhibits a notably robust positive correlation\nof 88.5% with \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection,\" hence emphasizing their significant alignment.\nMoreover, there exists a strong positive correlation of 80.1% between the construct of \"Supplier\nDevelopment\" and the construct of \"Long Term Supplier Relationships,\" highlighting the significant\ninterdependence of both variables. The variable \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection\" demonstrates\na significant positive correlation of 79.2% with the variable \"Long Term Supplier Relationships,\"\nindicating a robust link between the two. There exists a positive association between \"Cost\nEfficiency\" and all elements of supplier relationship management, as evidenced by the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients. It is worth noting that the variable \"Cost Efficiency\" exhibits a substantial\npositive correlation of 72.8% with the variable \"Supplier Collaboration,\" a positive correlation of\n70.2% with \"Supplier Development,\" a positive correlation of 68.5% with \"Supplier Evaluation and\nSelection,\" and a notably high positive correlation of 78.2% with \"Long Term Supplier\nRelationships.\" In summary, the aforementioned data suggest that when supplier management\ntechniques adopt a more collaborative approach, prioritize development, incorporate evaluation\nmeasures, and aim to cultivate long-term partnerships, there is a notable enhancement in \"Cost\nEfficiency.\" The percentages presented in the data indicate the magnitude and orientation of these\nconnections, underscoring the noteworthy influence of proficient supplier relationship\nmanagement on cost effectiveness, a critical facet of organizational efficacy.\n5.2 Regression Analysis\nTable 4 - Model Summary\nModel R\nR\nSquare\nAdjusted\nR\nSquare\nStd.\nError of\nthe\nEstimate\nChange Statistics\nR\nSquare\nChange\nF\nChange\ndf1 df2\nSig.

The table\npresents a strong positive linear association between the dependent variable (not specified in the\ntable) and a group of independent variables, including SRM practices such as Supplier\nCollaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, and Long-Term Supplier\nRelationships, as indicated by an R-value of .801. The considerable R-value highlights the model's\ncapacity to elucidate fluctuations in the dependent variable. The coefficient of determination,\nrepresented by the symbol R\u00b2, is seen to be 0.642. This implies that around 64.2% of the variability\nobserved in the dependent variable may be ascribed to the impact of the SRM practices used in the\nmodel. The observed R\u00b2 value indicates that the set of SRM practices under consideration make a\nsubstantial contribution towards explaining the variability observed in the dependent variable.\nAdditionally, the adjusted R\u00b2, which accounts for the number of predictors in the model,\ndemonstrates a robust value of .637.

The standard error of the estimate, which\nrepresents the mean variation between projected and actual values, is calculated to be .69525. This\nmetric offers a measure of the model's accuracy in forecasting the values of the dependent variable.\nThe change statistics section provides evidence of a significant enhancement in the model's fit\nwhen using the SRM practices as predictors. The F-statistic, which has a value of 118.993, along with\na p-value of .000 that is highly significant, provides confirmation of the overall relevance of the\nmodel incorporating these predictors. The aforementioned observation highlights the significance\nand pertinence of the Strategic Risk Management (SRM) techniques when elucidating the\nfluctuations observed in the dependent variable. In summary, the Model Summary table indicates\nthat the regression model, which includes SRM practices as predictors, is statistically significant and\nhas a strong ability to account for a significant portion of the variability in the dependent variable.\nThis underscores the importance of these practices in the context of the study.\nTable 5 - ANOVAa\nModel Sum of\nSquares\ndf Mean\nSquare\nF Sig.\n1 Regression 230.073 4 57.518 118.993 .000b\nResidual 128.094 265 .483\nTotal 358.167 269\na.

In\ncontrast, the Residual part pertains to the unexplained variance and presents a sum of squares\nequal to 128.094, which is accompanied by 265 degrees of freedom. The Total Sum of Squares (TSS),\nwhich measures the total variance in \"Cost Efficiency,\" is calculated to be 358.167.\nThe F-statistic, a crucial metric, is computed as 118.993 by dividing the mean square for the\nregression by the mean square for the residual. This statistical measure evaluates the overall\nsignificance of the regression model. The p-value, shown as \"Sig.,\" is significantly small (p = .000).\nThe obtained p-value, which is remarkably low, provides strong evidence that the regression model,\nencompassing Long-Term Supplier Relationships, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, Supplier\nCollaboration, and Supplier Development as predictor variables, is highly significant in elucidating\nthe fluctuations observed in \"Cost Efficiency.\" In more accessible language, these predictor\nvariables together considerably improve the model's capacity to explain the differences found in\n\"Cost Efficiency.\" Therefore, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) findings offer strong statistical\nsupport for the model's ability to effectively elucidate and forecast cost efficiency within the\nframework of supplier relationship management procedures.\nTable 6 - Coefficients\nModel Unstandardized\nCoefficients\nStandardized\nCoefficients\nt Sig.\nB Std.

Dependent Variable: Cost Efficiency\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n11/18\nThe examination of the coefficients in Table 5 allows for the analysis of the regression model,\nproviding valuable insights into the distinct impacts of each predictor variable on the dependent\nvariable, \"Cost Efficiency.\" The constant term in the equation represents the baseline level of \"Cost\nEfficiency\" in the absence of any predictor factors. The observed phenomenon exhibits an\nunstandardized coefficient (B) of -0.303, accompanied by a standard error of 0.270. The t-statistic\nassociated with the given data is -1.121, resulting in a p-value of 0.263. This p-value is above the\ncommonly accepted significance level of 0.05. Therefore, it may be concluded that the constant\nterm does not possess statistical significance in its ability to explain the fluctuations observed in\n\"Cost Efficiency.\" Shifting our focus towards the independent factors, the variable \"Supplier\nCollaboration\" holds considerable importance. The unstandardized coefficient (B) is reported as\n0.342, with a standard error of 0.109, and a standardized coefficient (Beta) of 0.275. The predictor\nexhibits a t-statistic of 3.146, accompanied by a p-value of 0.002, indicating a significant and positive\ninfluence on the variable \"Cost Efficiency.\" More precisely, there is a positive correlation between a\none-unit increase in supplier collaboration and a 0.342-unit improvement in \"Cost Efficiency.\" On\nthe other hand, the variable \"Supplier Development\" demonstrates a coefficient (B) of 0.027, which\nlacks standardization, accompanied with a standard error of 0.114. Nevertheless, the standardized\ncoefficient (Beta) for this variable is only 0.022, indicating a minimal impact. The t-statistic for the\npredictor variable is calculated to be 0.233, with a corresponding p-value of 0.816. This p-value\nexceeds the commonly accepted significance level of 0.05. Therefore, the variable \"Supplier\nDevelopment\" does not exhibit a statistically significant impact on the variable \"Cost Efficiency.\"\nSimilarly, the variable \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection\" is found to have an unstandardized\ncoefficient (B) of -0.007, with a corresponding standard error of 0.118. The standardized coefficient\n(Beta) has a value of -0.005. The t-statistic for the predictor in question is -0.058, and its\ncorresponding p-value is 0.954, both of which are significantly beyond the conventional threshold\nfor statistical significance. Therefore, the variable \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection\" does not\ndemonstrate a statistically significant influence on the variable \"Cost Efficiency.\" Finally, the variable\n\"Long Term Supplier Relationships\" appears as a significantly influential predictor. The\nunstandardized coefficient (B) is reported as 0.681, accompanied by a standard error of 0.082.\nAdditionally, the standardized coefficient (Beta) is reported as 0.550, indicating a significant effect.\nThe t-statistic for the predictor variable exhibits robustness, measuring 8.332. The related p-value\nis 0.000, indicating a significant and positive impact on the variable \"Cost Efficiency.\" Specifically, an\nincrease of one unit in long-term supplier connections is associated with a significant rise of 0.681\nunits in \"Cost Efficiency.\" In summary, the variables of \"Supplier Collaboration\" and \"Long Term\nSupplier Relationships\" demonstrate statistically significant relationships with positive impacts on\n\"Cost Efficiency.\" However, the variables of \"Supplier Development\" and \"Supplier Evaluation and\nSelection\" do not exhibit such statistical significance in explaining variations in the dependent\nvariable.\n5. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS OF FINDINGS\nThe study's findings provide useful insights into the connections between SRM practices and\nsupply chain performance, with a specific emphasis on cost efficiency. This analysis is conducted\nwithin the specific context of Bangladesh's industrial and service industries. The correlation study\ndemonstrates statistically significant relationships among the variables under investigation,\nemphasizing the strong linkages between Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier\nEvaluation and Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships, and Cost Efficiency. The presence of\npositive correlations suggests that the successful execution of SRM procedures has a key role in\nattaining cost-effectiveness in supply chain operations. The robust positive association between\nSupplier Collaboration and Supplier Development highlights the interdependence of both SRM\ncharacteristics. Organizations that participate in cooperative efforts and allocate resources to\nincrease the competencies of their suppliers are likely to achieve a synergistic outcome, resulting\nin enhanced cost effectiveness (Feizabadi & Alibakhshi, 2022; Shafiq et al., 2022; Uddin et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, the strong correlation between Supplier Collaboration and Supplier Evaluation and\nSelection underscores the significance of thorough evaluation and collaboration. This implies that\norganizations that prioritize both aspects simultaneously are more likely to achieve efficient and\neconomical supply chain operations. The strong positive association between Supplier\nDevelopment and Supplier Evaluation and Selection highlights the consistency between both\nprocedures. Organizations that allocate resources to supplier development projects are also prone\nto having clearly defined assessment and choice procedures, which in turn lead to improved cost\neffectiveness. Furthermore, the robust positive link between Supplier Development and Long-Term\nSupplier Relationships underscores the strategic interconnectedness of both aspects.\nOrganizations that prioritize the development of their suppliers are more likely to establish long\u0002lasting partnerships, which in turn leads to sustainable cost efficiency in the long run (Lahti et al.,\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n12/18\n2018; Larsson & Larsson, 2020; Prosser et al., 2021; Wren, 2022). The correlation between Long\u0002Term Supplier Relationships and Supplier Evaluation and Selection indicates that firms that\nmaintain long-term partnerships with important suppliers also place a high emphasis on thorough\nevaluation and selection procedures. This emphasizes the need of stability and trust in supplier\nrelationships for attaining cost-efficient supply chain operations. The regression analysis enhances\nthese insights by offering a comprehensive model summary. The model, which incorporates\nSupplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, and Long-Term\nSupplier Relationships as predictors, shows statistical significance in explaining the observed\nheterogeneity in Cost Efficiency. The high R-value and coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) suggest that\napproximately 64.2% of the variation in cost efficiency may be attributable to the influence of the\nSRM practices included in the model. The corrected R\u00b2, which takes into consideration the number\nof predictors, remains strong at 63.7%, confirming the model's effectiveness in explaining variability\nwithout overfitting. The substantial F-statistic in the ANOVA table provides additional confirmation\nof the model's overall significance, highlighting the combined influence of the predictor variables\non Cost Efficiency. The coefficients analysis offers comprehensive insights into the specific effects\nof each predictor variable. Supplier Collaboration and Long-Term Supplier Relationships are\nidentified as statistically significant factors that have a beneficial impact on Cost Efficiency.\nNevertheless, the effects of Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection on Cost\nEfficiency are not statistically significant.\nThe study's findings through the empirical results hold substantial implications for\norganizations in Bangladesh's manufacturing and service sectors, offering precise guidance on\noptimizing supply chain performance, particularly in terms of cost efficiency. The strong positive\nconnections observed between Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier Evaluation\nand Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships, and Cost Efficiency highlight the\ninterconnectedness of various aspects under SRM. Businesses must recognize the need of\nimplementing a thorough and unified approach to SRM processes to enhance cost efficiency in\ntheir supply chain operations. The importance of Supplier Collaboration and Long-Term Supplier\nRelationships in terms of strategic significance becomes evident as a crucial lesson. Organizations\nthat prioritize collaborating with suppliers and fostering long-lasting partnerships are well\u0002positioned to achieve ongoing cost reduction (Allioui & Mourdi, 2023). This highlights a change in\nviewpoint, encouraging businesses to see suppliers not only as transactional entities but as\nstrategic partners, cultivating enduring relationships that greatly contribute to the overall success\nof the supply chain. The correlation between Supplier Collaboration and Supplier Development\nimplies a mutually beneficial result when firms collaborate and invest in improving supplier skills.\nThis is consistent with the current body of research on collaborative supply chain methods and\ntheir influence on operational efficiency and cost reduction (Benton Jr et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2021;\nLo et al., 2018). Moreover, it is important to strengthen the argument of the significant association\nbetween Supplier Development and Long-Term Supplier Relationships by referencing research that\nemphasize the strategic interdependence of these factors. Empirical evidence demonstrating the\nenduring advantages of supplier development activities on fostering durable partnerships and\nenhancing cost efficiency would strengthen the claim (Cocskun et al., 2022; Faruquee et al., 2021;\nJia et al., 2023; Manuela et al., 2021; Rezaei Vandchali et al., 2020). Supplier Development remains\ncrucial in SRM, but its effect on cost efficiency depends on the presence of complementary\nstrategies, as indicated by the study. The integration of supplier development programs with\nrigorous supplier evaluation and selection processes is crucial. Organizations should prioritize not\nonly improving supplier competencies, but also conducting thorough evaluations and choosing\nsuppliers based on their performance, quality, and risk management. The strong correlation\nbetween Long-Term Supplier Relationships and Supplier Evaluation and Selection emphasizes the\nsignificance of stability and confidence in supplier connections. Organizations that establish long\u0002term cooperation with important suppliers are more inclined to prioritize comprehensive review\nand selection procedures, resulting in streamlined supply chain operations (Tay & Aw, 2021).\nTherefore, it may be inferred that making efforts in establishing and sustaining long-lasting\nrelationships with suppliers can result in a series of beneficial outcomes for many aspects of supply\nchain performance, such as improved cost effectiveness. Having highlighted in the above\ndiscussions, it is worth mentioning here that these discoveries provide practical and implementable\nknowledge for sustaining supply chain operations in Bangladesh. Emphasizing cooperative\nmethods, fostering enduring partnerships with crucial suppliers, and executing rigorous\nassessments of suppliers can greatly contribute to achieving cost effectiveness. The study suggests\nprospective areas for further research, promoting a thorough investigation of certain methods\nwithin Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection. Furthermore, conducting\ninquiries into industry-specific variables that impact these connections within the distinct setting of\nBangladesh could yield useful insights. In summary, the study provides accurate and useful advice\nfor firms dealing with the complex field of supply chain management in Bangladesh.\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n13/18\n6 CONCLUSION\nThe study intended to investigate the function of SRM in the changing economic environment\nof Bangladesh, specifically focusing on its influence on supply chain performance. During the\ninvestigation, it became evident that SRM methods have a beneficial impact on different aspects of\nthe supply chain, notably in relation to cost effectiveness. The results highlight the crucial\nsignificance of Supplier Collaboration and the establishment of enduring Supplier Relationships.\nThe study found strong positive associations, highlighting the interconnectedness of several\ncomponents of SRM. Organizations that actively collaborate and develop long-lasting partnerships\nwith suppliers are more likely to achieve sustained cost effectiveness in their supply chain\noperations. In contrast, the individual effects of Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and\nSelection on cost efficiency were not statistically significant. This suggests that the efficacy of these\nactivities may depend on the presence of complementary tactics or an integrated strategy. The\nstudy promotes a comprehensive comprehension of SRM, going beyond individual practices, in\norder to fully use its potential in the context of Bangladesh. The research findings offer useful\ninsights for professionals and policymakers in the manufacturing and service sectors of\nBangladesh. They emphasize the significance of implementing a thorough SRM strategy, regarding\nsuppliers as strategic allies, and cultivating lasting partnerships for sustained success in the supply\nchain. The study's practical implications provide valuable counsel for firms aiming to improve their\nsupply chain performance, specifically in terms of cost effectiveness. Notwithstanding the\ncontributions offered, it is imperative to recognize the limitations of the study. The findings may\nhave limited generalizability due to the emphasis on certain sectors and the presence of\noperational complexity. Potential areas for future research involve investigating industry-specific\nvariables that impact the success of SRM in Bangladesh, as well as conducting in-depth analysis of\npractices within Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection. The study establishes\na base for continued investigation of SRM in developing countries, with the goal of gaining a more\ndetailed comprehension of its intricacies and potential advantages.\nREFERENCES\nAbbas, H. & Tong, S.

The scanning interpretation\u2013action\u2013\nperformance model and organization information processing the\u0002ory are used to explain BDA, HSC innovation, responsiveness, and\nresilience relationships. First, the hypotheses were tested using\ndata collected from 190 experienced respondents working in the\nhealthcare industry. Our structural equation modeling analysis\nusing the partial least squares (PLS) method revealed that BDA\ncapabilities play a pivotal role in building a responsive HSC and\nimproving innovation, which has contributed to resilience dur\u0002ing the current pandemic situation. High innovation leadership\nstrengthens the effect of BDA capabilities on HSC innovation. High\ninnovation leadership also increases the effect of BDA capabilities\non responsiveness. Second, we validated and supplemented the em\u0002pirical research findings using inputs collected in 30 semistructured\nqualitative questionnaires. Our article makes a unique contribution\nfrom the perspective of innovation leaderships.

INTRODUCTION\nGLOBAL spending on healthcare is expected to dramati\u0002cally increase in the near future. This partially relates to\nchanging consumer requirements [1] as well as the higher expec\u0002tation on timely response to disasters [2]\u2013[4]. Most recently, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that healthcare supply\nchains (HSCs) are far from perfect. Not much improvements\nwere made from the experiences acquired during various prior\nepidemics such as middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)\nand severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [5], [6]. Massive\ndisruptions in HSCs have reached the level of a global crisis.\nThe availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), med\u0002ical equipment, and lifesaving drugs has been severely limited\n[7]\u2013[9]. Under COVID-19, high demands have challenged the\nHSC, highlighting the need to manage supply chains differently\nin crisis situations [9], [10]. Undoubtedly, supply chain respon\u0002siveness and innovation are essential to build a resilient HSC to\ncombat the COVID-19 pandemic when the demand uncertainties\nare extremely high [11], [12].\nIn the literature, Peeri et al. [6] pointed out the need to focus\non using digital technologies to monitor pandemic situations.\nIn particular, big data analytics (BDA) is a powerful tool to\nhelp [13]. For example, BDA supported inventory management\nof medical supplies during emergency responses is critical to\nensure the distribution of appropriate supplies [14]. Medical\ndevices with high volumes of data can apply BDA to under\u0002stand trends and future requirements of PPE. This enhances\nthe management and planning of activities in HSCs [1]. Dig\u0002ital technologies can remove barriers in pharmaceutical supply\nchains and improve flexibility and innovation related to drug\nsupplies, thereby enhancing coordination, information sharing,\nand minimizing wastes [2], [15].\nIn healthcare, BDA is valuable for environmental-scanning\n(forecasting and observation) purposes [10]. It helps predict the\nresults of drug administration, and analyze patient categorization\nand emergency response [16], all of which are of paramount\nsignificance during a pandemic like COVID-19 [13]. BDA not\nonly can sense information, it can also enhance interpreta\u0002tion to support key business decision making [17], [18] in a\ntimely manner [110]. Prior studies have shown that innovative\nsupply chains have the ability to manage risks, determine an\n\u00a9 IEEE 2021.

Note that innovation leaderships (IL) can improve supply\nchain innovation and, hence, improve efficiency [20].\nSupply chain responsiveness aims to reduce manufacturing\nthroughput and transportation/distribution lead times [21]. BDA\ncapabilities can assist in building a responsive supply chain\nthat positions resources and key players (suppliers, transporters,\ndistributors) at the right places to gain a competitive advantage\n[22]. BDA improves productivity in the supply chain process by\noffering an added level of flexibility [23]. Moreover, following\nthe arguments in [24], BDA can positively affect supply chain\ntransparency. Note that a few studies have examined the role of\nBDA in the HSC during pandemics (e.g., [25]\u2013[29]). However,\nno prior research has comprehensively examined the links be\u0002tween BDA and supply chain responsiveness and innovation\ntogether. This article aims to fill this gap in the context of\nCOVID-19.\nA recent insightful study by Dubey et al. [94] used the\norganization information processing theory (OIPT) to explain\nthe relationships between blockchain technology and opera\u0002tional supply chain transparency. Dubey et al. [94] further\nargued that blockchain technology and operational supply chain\ntransparency can further enhance collaboration among actors\nengaged in disaster relief operations and this finally leads to\nimproved supply chain resilience. This study supplements [94]\nand others in the related domain, and contributes to the supply\nchain resilience literature. It is noteworthy to mention one more\nimportant recent study on supply chain resilience by Dubey\net al. [95] who highlighted the importance of BDA in enhancing\ninformation processing capacity and supply chain resilience for\nfaster recovery after any disruptions. However, IL (which is\nrelated to supply chain resilience) for HSC innovation (SCI) is\nstill an underexplored area. Carmeli et al. [64] pointed out that\nIL increases strategic fit (internal/external) and further improves\nfirm performance. Hence, the role of leaders (irrespective of\nwhether they are political leaders of the country or leaders of\ncompanies) is crucial in this pandemic time. To be specific, IL\nincludes the proper way to encourage individuals to take vari\u0002ous initiatives, develop a transparent performance measurement\nsystem, and build an environment in which quality relationships\nwould be treasured. Having good IL will lead to increased\ncreativities in the organization [64]. Innovation is related to\n\u201cout-of-the-box\u201d thinking and introducing something new such\nas new ideas, methods, or devices. Innovations in the sphere\nof healthcare products and services are keys to combat the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and yield quick recovery from the current\nstate. Thus, innovative leadership is critical for establishing a\nresilient healthcare system.\nMotivated by the importance of BDA in HSCs and the critical\nrole of IL, we study the moderating effect of IL on the contri\u0002bution of BDA to SCI and responsiveness during COVID-19\npandemic. This article is unique from a few perspectives:\n1) we examine the effect of BDA on HSC responsiveness\n(RSC) and innovation;\n2) we investigate the effects of RSC and innovation on supply\nchain resilience.\n3) We adopt the multimethodological approach in deriving\nmore scientifically sound results.\nThe main research questions that the study sought to answer\nare as follows.\nRQ1: What are the effects of BDA on (i) supply chain respon\u0002siveness and (ii) supply chain innovation under the moderating\neffect of IL during the COVID-19 pandemic?\nRQ2: What are the effects of (i) responsive supply chain and\n(ii) supply chain innovation on HSC resilience (SCR) during\nCOVID-19 pandemic?\nThe theoretical model is built through the lenses of OIPT and\nscanning interpretation\u2013action\u2013performance (SIAP) modeling.\nWe argue that BDA is useful for environmental scanning and\ninformation processing to drive SCI (interpretation of key infor\u0002mation), which helps establish the responsive supply chain (ac\u0002tions). Finally, SCI and responsiveness are essential to build SCR\n(performance). During part 1 of the study, data were collected\nin South Africa using a structured questionnaire and hypotheses\nwere tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) applying\nthe partial least squares technique (PLS-SEM). In the second\npart, a thematic analysis was performed using the data obtained\nfrom 30 semistructured qualitative questionnaires. The themes\nthat emerged from this second-phase highlight major dimensions\nassociated with BDA in the HSC.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II\npresents the theoretical background and hypotheses, Section III\nprovides the methods used for conducting the analysis. Sec\u0002tion IV presents the data analysis. Finally, Section V and Sec\u0002tion VI concludes this article.\nII. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES\nDEVELOPMENT\nA. Organization Information Processing Theory\nOIPT theory proposes that organizations must enhance their\ninformation processing capacity to survive in an increasingly\nuncertain business environment [30], [31]. The COVID-19 pan\u0002demic has brought tremendous uncertainties to the lives of both\nhumans and businesses [32]. Uncertainty is driving the need\nfor building information processing capability [33], and compa\u0002nies involved in HSC need to leverage disruptive Industry 4.0\ntechnologies such as BDA to scan and process information and\nmake strategic decisions. OIPT explains how firms can develop\nthe information processing capability during the COVID-19\npandemic to assess external information such as supply crises,\nmarket demands, sales and competitors\u2019 distribution activities,\nrate of infection spreading, number of infected cases, number of\nrecoveries, number of deaths, and clinical trials monitoring and\noutcomes. Past studies have used OIPT to explain disruptions in\nsupply chains [34]. We argue that BDA enhances firms\u2019 infor\u0002mation processing capability during these uncertain pandemic\ntimes. Furthermore, supply chain innovation and responsive\u0002ness reduce uncertainty by fostering resilience. However, OIPT\ncannot single-handedly explain the entire mechanism (BDA\u2013\ninnovation\u2013responsiveness\u2013resilience). Therefore, we supple\u0002ment it with the SIAP model to better explain these relationships.\nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Theoretical model.\nB. SIAP Model\nFor the relationships among BDA, SCI, RSC, and SCR, we\ncan refer to Yu et al. [35], and the adopted SIAP model [36]\nand OIPT [37]. Whether operating at a local or international\nlevel, every business is influenced by external factors. Situations\nchange rapidly due to variations in political, environmental,\nor technological scenarios. Running a business is, therefore,\nan uneasy task, especially during turbulent times such as the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The SIAP model argues that firms adjust\nin the business environment by following three basic steps,\nnamely \u201cscanning, interpreting, and responding\u201d [38]. First,\norganizations scan information that can influence performance\n[36]. Accuracy is key to any effective environmental scanning\n[39], and BDA can be used to scan important data to generate\nuseful information from various internal and external sources to\ngain rich business insights and develop competitive edges [40],\n[41]. BDA fundamentally works by scanning information in the\nchanging business environment [42], [43]. Common sources of\nbig data include social media, websites, shop floor machines,\nmeters, and sensors.\nThere is enormous potential for BDA applications in the HSC\n[16]. BDA has been demonstrated to be a useful scanning tool\nthat can equip organizations with the ability to scan risks and\nreconfigure resources and competencies [44], [45]. The potential\nof artificial intelligence (AI) and BDA in fighting COVID-19 has\nbeen confirmed in the literature (see, e.g., [46]). BDA can be used\nto model the spread of infection during a pandemic, monitor\nclinical trials, and outcomes, which can be useful for framing\npolicy and controlling infection [16]. Big data generated from\nsocial media, smart phones, and other digital equipment can be\nimmensely helpful in controlling the spread of COVID-19 [13].\nThe second step in SIAP is \u201cinterpretation,\u201d whereby manage\u0002ment uses diverse models as information processing methods to\nunderstand and label information [36]. Managers can make use\nof information to identify opportunities and threats. We argue\nthat firms should resort to supply chain innovation involving\nall stakeholders to pursue creative methods and services. The\nthird step is \u201caction,\u201d i.e., the strategic initiatives that the firm\nundertakes to adapt in the changing business environment, which\ncan range from slight shifts in procedures of the business pro\u0002cesses to major alterations in product, sales, and distribution\nstrategies. We argue that RSC is a strategic initiative to respond\nfacing the COVID-19 pandemic. The final step of the SIAP\nmodel is \u201cperformance\u201d [36]. We argue that SCR is the final\noutcome that every healthcare organization intends to achieve\nduring pandemic situation.\nC. Theoretical Model and Research Hypotheses\nThe theoretical model built based on the abovementioned\ndiscussion is presented in Fig. 1. Although big data drives\nsupply chain innovation, studies on BDA methods that can\nhelp organizations to enhance innovation are limited [47]. In\naddition, research initiatives on leveraging BDA to unlock values\nrequire further investigation [48]. Previous studies have shown\nhow BDA can positively influence supply chain sustainability\n[40], [48]. We argue that BDA has a positive association with\nRSC and innovation, whereby innovation has the ability to\ndevelop highly responsive supply chains, and innovation and\nresponsiveness lead to supply chain resilience. In this article,\nwe also introduce \u201cIL\u201d as a moderating variable to examine its\neffect on the relationships between \u201cBDA and health care supply\nchain responsiveness\u201d and \u201cBDA and SCI.\u201d\n1) BDA and Supply Chain Responsiveness and Innovation:\nNowadays, the numbers of actors and products in modern supply\nchains are much higher than before. Organizations generally\nprefer big data solutions to curb problems in the supply chain\nnetwork [49]. BDA involves collecting, managing, and process\u0002ing a high volume of data generated from various sources. These\nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal. Content is final as presented, with the exception of pagination.\n4 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT\ndata can be both structured and unstructured in form, and BDA\ncan be used to analyze them and unlock their value [50]. Under\nCOVID-19, the pandemics create a disaster situation and disrupt\nsupply chains because the local and international borders remain\nclosed to prevent the spread of infection. In this type of situation,\nrapid action is required to make radical changes in the supply\nchain that are only possible using BDA information processing\ncapabilities for scanning environmental information [51].\nIn an HSC, big data is generated from internal enterprise\nresource planning (ERP systems) and external sources (social\nmedia, mobile devices, data portals, and data market platforms).\nThe non structured query language (NoSQL) graph databases\nare useful for optimizing and configuring supply chains. The\nApache Hadoop platform is immensely helpful for managing\nhigh volumes of data, and MapReduce helps perform the ana\u0002lytics part to extract information [52]. During pandemic times,\nbatch analysis is untenable to manage when a vast amount of data\nare generated in the HSC. However, the Lambda architecture can\nanalyze real-time data flows by supporting data stream analytics.\nEvery minute, the data of infected patients, status of infection\nspread, current drugs, and other medical device requirements\nat different locations can be gathered using an advanced ICT\nplatform. Further data streams can be analyzed using complex\nevent processing programs. AutoID digital technologies can be\nuseful for tracking purposes as well [49], [53]. BDA can extract\ninformation that can be useful for making decisions related to\nHSC configurations [54]. However, it is important that data\nscientists and data analysts would closely monitor and control\nthe quality of data to prevent inaccurate information generation\n[55]. Therefore, we establish the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis H1: BDA capabilities have a positive relationship with\nRSC.\nBDA can also offer new opportunities for supply chain in\u0002novation [56]. New vaccines and drugs are required to combat\npandemic situations [57]. Moreover, the shortage of equipment\nsuch as PPE for front-line doctors and healthcare workers can\nbe resolved by securing specialized PPE and making alternative\nPPE products using 3-D printing and advanced manufacturing.\nIn addition, digital contact tracing apps can play an important\nrole by tracking disease spread [58].\nInnovation can involve the development of new products\nwith unique features, alternative manufacturing methods, eco\u0002friendly raw materials for manufacturing, new approaches to\ntransportation and distribution, and the development of new\nprocesses that can yield huge benefits for society at large as\nwell as firms [59]. Big data generation capabilities, data integra\u0002tion and management capabilities, advanced analytics, and data\nvisualization capabilities can be immensely useful for supply\nchain innovation [49], [59]. Therefore, we have the following\nhypothesis.\nHypothesis H2: BDA capabilities have a positive relationship with\nSCI.\n2) Moderating Effects of IL: In this article, we have used\nOIPT to explain the role of BDA in information processing for\nreducing uncertainties. However, in the literature, Hau\u00dfmann\net al. [32, p. 81] highlighted certain shortcomings of the original\nOIPT theory, which includes the point that interpersonal charac\u0002teristics and information restrictions are not taken into account.\nInterpersonal characteristics here include leadership, teamwork,\netc. To overcome the limitations of the original theory, we made\nreference to Hambrick and Mason [96] in which the authors\nconceptualized the \u201cupper echelons\u201d perspective and argued that\nfirm performance is shaped by managerial background charac\u0002teristics. \u201cUpper echelons\u201d based leadership theory can put some\nlight on the observable managerial characteristics that the leader\ncan bring to an administrative circumstance. Observable charac\u0002teristics such as age, functional tracks, other career experiences,\neducation, socioeconomic roots, financial position, and group\ncharacteristics would all influence the strategic choices made\nby top management and leaders [96]. Undoubtedly, product\ninnovation is one of the strategic choices that leaders make for\nimproving firm performance [96]. As a remark, Carmeli et al.\n[64] argued that IL can improve strategic fit and further enhance\nthe firm performance. IL is related to the innovative nature of\norganization leaders that ranges from emphasizing on teamwork,\nclarifying individual responsibility, providing clear feedbacks\nto employees, emphasizing on task orientation, encouraging\ninitiatives, and developing trust among employees [64].\nIn an uncertain business environment under COVID-19, it\nis very difficult to forecast and plan activities. Disasters and\npandemic situations exacerbate the uncertainty, and if leaders\ncontinue to work with the same approach used under normal\ncircumstances, then their businesses will not survive the impact.\nInnovative leadership can be highly effective for managing\nbusiness challenges during pandemic situations.\nApplying innovative thinking to leadership tasks can spur\nemployees to begin thinking in innovative ways and further use\nBDA to configure the HSC and pull the firm out of danger [60].\nLearning and teamwork are required to improve environmental\ntraining and configure supply chains for sustainability outcomes\n[61], [62]. Training forms part of the Industry 4.0 delivery system\nand is important in sustainable development [63].\nAll of the abovementioned human resource factors are an\u0002tecedents of IL [20]. IL improves organizational performance\nand contributes to a firm\u2019s strategic positioning within the busi\u0002ness environment [64]. Importance of human resource man\u0002agement, involving IL and responsive management for supply\nchain sustainability, is highlighted in [12], which argued that the\ngreater the IL, the more pronounced the effect of BDA informa\u0002tion processing capabilities on building responsive HSC. Some\nother studies have demonstrated that leadership thinking based\non extensive information will enhance configuration decisions\n[65], [66]. Therefore, we have the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis H3: IL has a moderating effect on BDA capabilities and\nRSC.\nIL is essential for managing the same supply chain tasks\nin a new way [60]. Many important decisions must be made\nduring disasters caused by the COVID-19 pandemic [4], and\ninnovative leadership can foster innovative thinking by the\nteam and result in innovative solutions that can be helpful for\nhumankind. Unique solutions can involve deploying robots to\nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

The greater\nthe IL in the organization, the greater is the activation of BDA\ninformation processing capabilities on SCI [20], [49]. Therefore,\nwe propose the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis H4: IL has a moderating effect on BDA capabilities and\nsupply chain innovation.\n3) SCI, Responsiveness, and Resilience: During a pandemic\nsuch as COVID-19, the configuration of the HSC requires signif\u0002icant modifications to enable changes in business processes that\ncan benefit patients and facilitate the economical distribution\nof essential medical goods and devices. It may be necessary to\nrestructure old supply chain structures to transform them into\nnew structures and develop innovative approaches and capabil\u0002ities [68]. Changing suppliers and supply chain processes can\nenable the application of innovative technologies and thereby\ndrive agile and responsive processes to counter changes. We,\nhence, have the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis H5: SCI has a positive relationship with RSC.\nThe HSC can be optimized by reconfiguring its resources\nto make the healthcare supply more resilient [4]. The ability\nto quickly configure the supply chain will enhance the ability\nof the HSC to become responsive and effectively fight against a\npandemic, which will save time and efforts while using resources\nmore effectively. This ultimately brings an added benefit to\nthe society [4], [69]. Changing the supply chain configuration\nand quickly responding to market changes will help to reduce\nnegative effects from repeated risk and improve supply chain\nresilience [11]. Therefore, we build the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis H6: RSC has a positive relationship with SCR for pan\u0002demic response.\nAn innovative supply chain design influences the choice of\nvendors and results in cooperation with important suppliers as\nwell as impacting supply chain efficiency and quality-related\npractices [14]. Working in a collaborative manner with suppliers\nand integrating operations for improved efficiency can result in\ninnovation [70]. In the HSC, innovation initiatives are important\nto meet increasing demands for better services in a timely\nmanner for patients [71]. Innovation in the HSC can reduce the\ndistance between warehouses and affected areas [72]. Innovation\ncan also contribute to the cheaper manufacturing of products and\nmake them available quickly based on demand. Only innovative\napproaches can make the HSC more resilient and help manage\npandemic situations more effectively [11], [72]. Therefore, we\nhave the following hypothesis.\nHypothesis H7: SCI has a positive relationship with SCR for pan\u0002demic response.\nIII. RESEARCH METHODS1\nA multimethod approach [73] is used in this study. Multi\u0002method approaches are commonly utilized to validate findings in\ntechnology and operations management research [73]\u2013[75]. This\narticle was conducted in the following two phases: I) quantitative\nsurvey and testing of theoretical model using variance-based\nSEM and II) semistructured qualitative questionnaires and the\u0002matic analysis. Saunders et al.[104] pointed out a very important\npart of academic research, i.e., data collection. Data are linked\nwith the answering the research questions. Therefore, \u201cwhat type\nof data is required\u201d and \u201cwhat techniques are necessary to collect\nthe data\u201d are both critical decisions in any empirical research\nstudy. Saunders et al. [104] conceptualized the data collection\nprocess as the central part of the research onion. Selection of\ndata collection techniques and analysis processes are critical to\nproduce a good research output. We previously indicated that\nthe multimethod approach was used to reach to the \u201ccentre of\nthe onion,\u201d i.e., answer the central research questions. We did\nnot simply peel off the important outer layers of the onion and\nthrown them away. We had carefully selected the techniques,\nwith a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques,\nin both data collection and analyses. The rationale behind using\nthese methods is as follows: First, to overcome the limitation of\nempirical surveys (i.e., to have the triangulation effect). Second,\nto gain richer insights from the practitioner\u2019s perspectives. In\nthe first phase, we used a structured questionnaire and further\nanalyzed the theoretical model. In such a process, we established\nthe links and contributed to the literature. However, the primary\ndata/empirical survey did not provide rich and deeper insights\nabout the underlying mechanism, which was made possible\nthrough the use of qualitative surveys with selected respondents\n(considered from the same sampling frame from phase 1). The\nqualitative analysis further provided understanding about the\nrelationships to a greater extent that was not possible with quan\u0002titative study. Results of the qualitative study can also verify if the\nquantitative findings are valid or not. This enhances research rig\u0002ors. The research flowchart is presented in Fig. 2. Note that this\napproach follows the philosophy proposed by Choi et al. [73].\nA. Construct Operationalization\nThe survey items were adopted from the existing literature.\nThe five-item BDA construct was taken from Arunachalam\net al. [47], the six-item SCI construct was adapted from Kwak et\nal. [11], the five-item RSC construct consisting of five items was\nadapted from Parmigiani et al. [68], the four-item IL construct\nwas adapted from Yoon et al. [20] and the eight-item SCR for\npandemic response construct was adapted from Sabegh et al.\n[4]; and Kwak et al. [11]. The details are provided in Table A1\n(Online Supplementary Appendix A).\nB. Sampling and Data Collection\nThe target population for this article comprised general man\u0002agers, senior managers, managers, junior managers, and other\n1The authors sincerely thank a reviewer for reminding us the importance to\nclarify the idea behind the multimethod study.\nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

Research flowchart.\nhealthcare sector professionals responsible for sourcing, man\u0002ufacturing, logistics, distribution, research, and development.\nThe companies were selected from among the most relevant\ndatabases in the context of our article, namely the \u201cInnovation\nPharmaceutical Association of South Africa,\u201d \u201cGeneric and\nBiosimilar Medicines of South Africa,\u201d and \u201cBioPharmGuy.\u201d\nThe total number of members listed in these directories com\u0002bined is approximately 1200.\nIt was determined that 30 representative participants would be\na reasonable minimum recommendation for a pilot study [76],\n[77]. The questionnaire was developed based on a five-point\nLikert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral,\n4=Agree, 5=Strongly Agree). The questionnaire was e-mailed\n(using Google Forms) to 37 managers for a pilot survey assess\u0002ment. After the responses and comments were received, seven\nquestions were reworded before distributing the final survey.\nSampling targeted a total of 550 potential respondents, who\nwere selected using random sampling technique, and the final\nquestionnaire was sent (using Google Forms) to two respon\u0002dents from each company. No incentive was offered or given\nto survey participants. After two rounds of follow-up, a total\nof 190 responses were received, representing a response rate of\n34 percent. Questionnaires were received from 78 respondents\nwere received at the end of April 2020, and after conducting\nfollow-up, we received data from an additional 112 respondents\nat the end of May 2020. We did not receive any incomplete\nsubmissions, as the questionnaire was designed only to accept\ncomplete submissions.\nThe demographic profile of the survey participants is pre\u0002sented in Table A2 (Online Supplementary Appendix A). The\nhighest number of responses was received from profession\u0002als working in the healthcare industry for over 15 years, and\nmost responses were received from companies operating in\nSouth Africa for more than 20 years. Responses were received\nfrom pharmaceutical product and medical device manufacturers,\nbiotechnology companies, medical product distributors, medical\nretailers, and clinical research institutes. The largest number of\nresponses was received from biotech companies, followed by\nmedical device manufacturers. The analysis also indicated that\nmost responses were received from big companies with annual\nturnover of more than 50 million South African Rands.\nC. Nonresponse Bias (NRB)\nSince data were received in two phases, we checked NRB by\njudging the first and second wave of responses, with the second\nwave (i.e., late responses) being regarded as a control group\nstanding in for those who did not respond (for example, see\n[80]). Homogeneity of variance test was performed to determine\nif there was any difference between both sets of responses. The\nnonsignificant results indicated that our article was free from\nNRB.\nThis article has been accepted for inclusion in a future issue of this journal.

BDA capabilities.\nD. Qualitative Study Methodology\nThe semistructured, open-ended questionnaire (Online Ap\u0002pendix B) used to collect qualitative data was adapted from\nSheng et al. [85] and consisted of the following two sections:\nthe first section intended to capture the demographic profile of\nrespondents, and the second section consisted of seven questions\nintended to capture the potential of BDA in developing resilient\nHSCs. To avoid any form of common method bias (CMB), a\nclear note at the top of the questionnaire explained that the\ndata collection is purely for academic purpose and the names\nand personal details of the respondents will not be disclosed at\nany point of time. The number of questions was kept minimum\nto avoid respondents becoming bored or losing patience while\nanswering such descriptive questions. The questionnaire was\ncreated on Google Forms and the link was emailed to 30 po\u0002tential respondents who were part of the initial empirical survey\nperformed during phase 1 of this article. The request to complete\nthe questionnaire was sent at the end of January 2021, and all of\nthe data was received by early February 2021. Responses were\nreceived from all 30 participants. Previous studies have used 20\nsamples; therefore, a sample size of 30 is acceptable for this\nstudy [86]. Finally, the thematic analysis acts as an input for\nthe triangulation of the results obtained from the previous stage.\nExcel was used to perform the coding, followed by grouping\nunder subthemes and extracting the main themes.\nIV. DATA ANALYSIS\nThe data obtained during the primary study in phase 1 is\ndepicted in Figs. 3\u20137. Fig. 3 indicates that there are five items\n(BDA1, BDA2, BDA3, BDA4, and BDA5) that were used to\nmeasure the latent construct BDA capabilities. It also shows the\nresponses received during the primary survey for instance if we\nlook at the item BDA1, out of total 190 responses: 5 selected\nstrongly disagree, i.e., 2.6%; 1 selected disagree, i.e., 0.52%, 0\nneutral, 79 selected agree, i.e., 41.57%, 105 selected strongly\nagree, i.e., 55.26%.\nFig. 4 indicates that there are four items (IL1, IL2, IL3, and\nIL4) that were used to measure the latent construct IL.

SEM Applying the Partial Least Squares Technique\nTwo types of SEM techniques are commonly applied, they\nare namely: 1) the covariance-based method, and 2) the partial\nleast squares method. PLS-SEM is widely used by researchers\nin various fields [79]. Many research papers are available that\ncritically examined the pros and cons of PLS-SEM [100]\u2013[102].\nIn this article, we followed the guidelines of Hair et al. [103].\nWhen the objective of this article is mainly on \u201cprediction and\nexplanation,\u201d then PLS-SEM is recommended. For the case with\n\u201creflective model specification,\u201d both PLS-SEM and CB-SEM\ncan be used. For smaller sample sizes, PLS-SEM is recom\u0002mended. Keeping in mind all these points, we opted for the\nPLS-SEM technique. The software WarpPLS (version 6.0) was\napplied for conducting the SEM analysis. We do understand\nthat no single method is perfect. There are pros and cons of\neach method. To enhance research rigors, we have adopted the\nmultimethod approach (see Fig. 2).\nB. Common Method Bias\nThe problems associated with the effect of method bias have\nlong been highlighted in the literature [97]\u2013[99]. In many cases,\nthe instructions at the beginning of a questionnaire can influence\nresponses in a particular way (e.g., by implying the desirability\nof certain responses), thereby introducing common variation\namong the indicators and contaminating key results by inflating\npath coefficients due to the introduction of multicollinearity.\nFollowing the guidelines of MacKenzie and Podsakoff [98],\nwe carefully designed the questionnaire. First, to ensure the\nquestions could be easily understood, we pretested the questions\nin our preliminary trial survey. Second, we selected respondents\nwho had the necessary experience about BDA in the healthcare\nindustry. Third, we avoided the use of highly complex and\nabstract questions. Fourth, we took away \u201citem ambiguity\u201d by\nusing a clear and concise language. Fifth, we did not keep any\ndouble-barrelled questions. Sixth, we refocused questions to ask\nabout the current pandemic states because this would minimize\nefforts required for retrieval of information.\nIn addition, we performed Harman\u2019s single-factor test on all\nthe constructs [108]. We conducted the standard exploratory\nfactor analysis by selecting the principal component. We further\nchecked the unrotated factor solution to determine the number of\nfactors. The findings did not produce any individual dominating\nfactor which indicates nonexistence of CMB.\nLastly, the research team checked whether CMB was present\nby applying a full collinearity test to examine both vertical\nand lateral collinearities [78], [79]. If the variance inflation\nfactors (VIFs) are above 3.3, the collinearity issues exist and\nthe model suffers the CMB problem. This is a highly sensitive\nCMB criterion that tends to identify CMB where other methods\nprovide false negatives [78]. In the current study, the VIF values\nwere all found to be lower than 3.3, and we can, therefore,\nconclude that our model does not suffer the CMB problem.\nC. Measurement Model\n1) Validity and Reliability: The internal consistency of the\nlatent constructs was checked, and Cronbach\u2019s alpha test was\nused to check the reliability of the instrument. All Cronbach\u2019s\nalpha values except IL (0.658) and RSC (0.621) were higher\nthan 0.70 (BDAC: 0.868, SCI: 0.893, SCR: 0.749, IL\u2217BDAC:\n0.912). Since the measurement of these constructs was sensitive\nto the number of items in the respective scales, the research team\nalso checked the composite reliability of all latent constructs.\nComposite reliability is a preferred alternative to Cronbach\u2019s\nalpha test in the context of the data analysis method employed,\nand composite reliability values above 0.60 are acceptable in so\u0002cial science research. The results indicate acceptable reliability\n(BDAC: 0.908, IL: 0.793, SCI: 0.920, RSC: 0.771, SCR: 0.812,\nIL\u2217BDAC: 0.929). Average variances extracted (AVEs) were\ncalculated to assess convergent validity based on the widely used\nthreshold of 0.50 [81], [82]. The values obtained (BDAC: 0.670,\nIL: 0.598, SCI: 0.662, RSC: 0.505, SCR: 0.599, IL\u2217BDAC:\n0.542) suggest that our measurement model displays acceptable\nconvergent validity.\nUsing square roots of AVEs for the latent constructs in com\u0002bination with latent construct correlations, the research team\nalso investigated discriminant validity by following the Fornell\u2013\nLarcker criterion, i.e., for any latent variable, the square root\nof the AVE must be higher than its correlation with any other\nlatent variable [81], [82]. The results are showcased in Table\nA3 (Online Supplementary Appendix). These results suggest\nthat our measurement model displays acceptable discriminant\nvalidity.\n2) Model Fit and Quality Indices: The quality of the research\nmodel was checked using both classic model fit indices and\nmore modern causality assessment indices, as outlined in the\nfollowing. The classic model fit indices used were the aver\u0002age path coefficient (APC), average R-squared (ARS), average\nadjusted R-squared (AARS), average block variance inflation\nfactor (AVIF), and average full collinearity VIF (AFVIF) [83].\nIt is recommended that the p values for APC, ARS, and AARs\nbe less than or equal to 0.05, and these conditions were met (APC\n= 0.514, p"

It applies\nestablished approaches for analysing ethics of emerging technologies to undertake a systematic review of\npossible benefits and concerns. The methodology combines ethical issues identified by Anticipatory Technology\nEthics, Ethical Impact Assessment, and Ethical Issues of Emerging ICT Applications with AI-specific issues from\nthe literature. These are applied to analyse ChatGPT\u2019s capabilities to produce humanlike text and interact\nseamlessly. The analysis finds ChatGPT could provide high-level societal and ethical benefits. However, it also\nraises significant ethical concerns across social justice, individual autonomy, cultural identity, and environ\u0002mental issues. Key high-impact concerns include responsibility, inclusion, social cohesion, autonomy, safety,\nbias, accountability, and environmental impacts. While the current discourse focuses narrowly on specific issues\nsuch as authorship, this analysis systematically uncovers a broader, more balanced range of ethical issues worthy\nof attention. Findings are consistent with emerging research and industry priorities on ethics of generative AI.\nImplications include the need for diverse stakeholder engagement, considering benefits and risks holistically\nwhen developing applications, and multi-level policy interventions to promote positive outcomes. Overall, the\nanalysis demonstrates that applying established ethics of technology methodologies can produce a rigorous,\ncomprehensive foundation to guide discourse and action around impactful emerging technologies like ChatGPT.\nThe paper advocates sustaining this broad, balanced ethics perspective as use cases unfold to realize benefits\nwhile addressing ethical downsides.\n1. Introduction\nChatGPT, the web-based interactive system based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT\nlarge language models is expected to have transformative impact on\nmany aspects of society. It raises huge expectations, has attracted sig\u0002nificant investment and causes wide-spread concerns. There is much\ndiscussion in the media and a rapidly growing academic discussion on its\nbenefits and ethical downsides. This existing discourse focuses on some\nhigh-profile topics, such as academic authorship, but currently lacks a\nsystematic approach.\nAs we show in Section 2, the current discussion of ethics of ChatGPT\nremains one-sided, not only in its focus on specific issues but also in a\nlack of balance of considering ethical benefits and concerns. Rebalanc\u0002ing the debate is not just of academic interest but is called for in practical\nterms as well. Organisations making use of such technologies need\nreliable guidance and policymakers providing this guidance need to\ndevelop it on the basis of a broad-based and academically reliable\nfoundation. This article proposes such a foundation that builds on well\u0002established research and helps overcome the ad-hoc nature of current\nwork on ethics of ChatGPT.\nThe objective of this article is to provide a systematic analysis and\nrigorous review of the ethics of ChatGPT and, by implication, of related\ntechnologies based on large language models. This is achieved by\napplying established research methods that were developed to investi\u0002gate ethical issues of emerging technologies. Drawing on three such\nmethods as well as insights from the ethics of AI debate, we explore\nethical benefits and concerns that likely applications of ChatGPT using a\nlist or 93 partly overlapping possible issues identified from prior\nliterature.\nThe paper is structured as follows. The next section will review the\ntheoretical background, introducing the ethics in technology, outlining\nChatGPT, its key features and their ethical implications, as well as the\n* Corresponding author at: School of Computer Science, University of Nottingham, UK.\nE-mail address: Bernd.stahl@nottingham.ac.uk (B.C.

This background\nprovides the basis for the methodology employed to analyse the ethics of\nChatGPT. The subsequent sections then discuss the structured ethical\nanalysis of ChatGPT, relevance of findings, and which open questions\nemerge from them. The article then spells out likely implications for\nresearch and practice.\n2. ChatGPT and the ethics of emerging digital technologies\nThis article aims to apply ideas developed in the context of ethics\u0002related research on emerging digital technologies to ChatGPT. It is\ntherefore important to first understand the theoretical background of\nethics that underpins ethics-related research. This section then discusses\nwhich benefits ChatGPT promises and which concerns it raises (Dwi\u0002vedi, Kshetri et al., 2023) before introducing approaches to the ethics of\nemerging technologies.\n2.1. Theoretical background\nThe current discussion of ChatGPT covers numerous technical as\u0002pects as well as current and likely applications. One crucial part of the\ndebate relates to ethical concerns that many contributors raise about the\nuse of ChatGPT. This article focuses on such ethical questions. Before we\ncan explore them in more detail, it is important to provide the concep\u0002tual and theoretical basis. The concept of ethics as used in the English\nlanguage has a number of related but non-identical meanings (Stahl,\n2012). In general terms it refers to questions involving moral concepts\nsuch as right and wrong, or good and bad. In most familiar contexts\nhumans intuitively know what is right and wrong, a knowledge of ethics\nthat is acquired during human socialisation. Sometimes this intuition\nfails or conflicts with others\u2019 intuitions, at which point ethics appears as\na set of explicit statements in the form of \u201cyou should never / always do\nX\u201d. Where such statements are not accepted and need justification,\nethics as a set of philosophical theories is called for. Ethics can be\ndescriptive or normative, abstract or applied.\nEthics as a philosophical discipline that is mostly concerned with\nexamining or justifying prescriptive rules and statements has a written\nhistory of several millennia. In the European context the roots of phil\u0002osophical ethics are typically traced back to Greek Antiquity. There are\nnumerous ethical theories that form the canon of philosophical ethics.\nOne that has its roots in Aristotle (2007) is that of virtue ethics which\nevaluates the ethical quality of an action or situation with reference to\nthe character of the actor. Other high-profile ethical theories include\ndeontology which judges the quality of an action by examining the\nintention of the agent undertaking it. This type of ethical reasoning is\nclosely associated with the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1788,\n1797). For Kant an action can only count as ethically good if it is\nmotivated by duty, which means that it must come from a purely\nrational insight into what should be done which Kant formulates as the\nso-called Categorical Imperative. A very different ethical theory is that\nof teleology, which uses the outcomes of an action to evaluate its ethical\nquality. This type of reasoning, also known as consequentialism is\nassociated with thinkers such as Bentham (1789) or Mill (1861). They\nsuggested that a suitable measure of ethics would be utility, which is\nwhy this type of thinking is also known as utilitarianism. One measure of\nutility is happiness, so that a well-known expression of this ethical po\u0002sition is that an action is ethically good, if it leads to the greatest\nhappiness for the greatest number of people.\nWhile it is important to realise that there are extensive theoretical\nunderpinnings to ethics as a philosophical discipline, it is worth noting\nthat there are focus areas within ethics that make use of specific aspects\nof this breadth of theory. Ethics of technology is typically seen as one\nbranch of applied ethics (Nijsingh & Duwell, 2009). Applied ethics aims\nto understand ethical questions arising in specific fields such as medicine\n(Freyhofer, 2004), business (Bowie, 1999; De George, 1999), or research\n(OECD, 2016). It often focuses on specific sub-fields or problems and\napplications. One field of applied ethics that has developed since that\n1970 s is that of computer ethics (Bynum, 2001; Moor, 1985) which has\nstrongly influenced the development of the ethics of AI (Stahl, 2021).\nWhile computer ethics is one root of the ethics of AI, there are other\nstreams of ethical considerations that are linked to some of the features\nof AI. One example of this stream of work can be described using the\nacronym FATE which stands for fairness, accountability, transparency\nand ethics (Memarian & Doleck, 2023) which mirrors the subject matter\nof the ACM conferences series on Fairness, Accountability and Trans\u0002parency (FAccT).\nFor the purposes of this article that explores ethical concerns arising\nfrom ChatGPT, it is important to start with a broad understanding of\nethical question that includes but goes beyond the current focus of FATE\nor FAccT. ChatGPT as an example of a large language model and thus of\nAI may well raise questions around fairness, accountability and trans\u0002parency, but its ethical concerns are likely to go beyond these estab\u0002lished topics. The paper is therefore theoretically grounded in the\nbroader computer ethics literature and builds more specifically on the\ntheoretical approach to the ethics of emerging technologies as explained\nin detail in the methodology section below. This theoretical angle of the\npaper allows for broader insights than the prevailing literature on AI and\nethics and therefore offers a theoretical justification for the research\nquestion. If ChatGPT turns out to be as impactful as is currently widely\npredicted, then we need theoretically sound and empirically rigorous\nand transparent research to proactively engage with its likely ethical and\nsocial consequences. The theoretical and methodological approach re\u0002ported in this article are geared to meet these requirements.\nIn order to follow this argument, it is important to understand which\naspects of ChatGPT are capable or giving rise to ethical questions, what\nthose questions are and how they are currently addressed.\n2.2. Literature on ChatGPT and ethics\nChatGPT is an interactive system that allows users to have conver\u0002sations using natural language. According to OpenAI, the organisation\nthat developed it, the dialogue format employed by ChatGPT allows it to\nanswer follow-up questions, admit mistakes, challenge incorrect pre\u0002mises and reject inappropriate requests (OpenAI, 2022). Technically,\nChatGPT is based on of OpenAI\u2019s Generative Pre-trained Transformer\nlanguage (GPT) models (particularly GPT-3 and GPT-4), a large-scale\nneural network-based language generation model trained on a wide\nrange of internet-based texts. It was trained using reinforcement\nlearning from human feedback. We refer to ChatGPT as a \u2018technology\u2019 in\nthe sense defined by the Encyclopaedia Britannica (2023) as \u201cthe\napplication of scientific knowledge to the practical aims of human life.\u201d\nWhile the article focuses on ChatGPT, its underlying interest is broader\nthan this particular example of a user-oriented technology. Competition\nfor ChatGPT is growing rapidly, e.g. in the form of Google\u2019s Bard (Metz\n& Grant, 2023), Alibaba\u2019s Tongyi Qianwen (McMorrow & Liu, 2023)\nand many others. We use ChatGPT as the most high-profile example of\nan interactive large language model because of its prominence in the\ndiscourse. Our analysis is based on key features of ChatGPT and is thus\napplicable to competitor technologies insofar as these share the same\ncharacteristics.\nGenerative AI systems or Chatbots like ChatGPT are not a new\nphenomenon. The idea that it should be possible to interact seamlessly\nwith a computer using natural language goes back to the beginnings of\ncomputing and AI research. The most prominent early example of such a\nchatbot may be ELIZA, a conversational program developed by Joseph\nWeizenbaum (1977) in the 1960 s. Early chatbots like ELIZA had limited\nfunctionality and adoption. With the progress of natural language pro\u0002cessing, better hardware and connectivity, chatbots have become more\nprominent. Most of the large tech companies have been trying to inte\u0002grate them into their service offerings. Examples include Apple\u2019s Siri,\nAmazon\u2019s Alexa or Microsoft Cortana.\nThe widespread existence, use and adoption of chatbot technologies\nB.C. Stahl and D. Eke\nInternational Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102700\n3\nraises the question why ChatGPT has managed to gain the level of\nattention that it has been receiving since its launch in November 2022.\nThe answer appears to be in the high quality of its outputs. ChatGPT can\ninteract across a broad range of topics, providing answers of high quality\nof language and good accuracy of content. The underlying technology,\nthe large amount of training data from the internet, and the model ar\u0002chitecture appear to have allowed ChatGPT to pass a previously invisible\nthreshold. Interaction with ChatGPT gives the impression that one has a\nconversation with an educated human who has subject expertise across a\nlarge number of subject areas.\nThe question why ChatGPT has risen to prominence is intimately\nlinked to the question of its social and ethical evaluation. Such an\nevaluation draws at least partly on real or expected practical conse\u0002quences of technology use which, in turn, are driven by the technology\u2019s\ncapability. We believe that the following characteristics and capabilities\nof ChatGPT may influence its use and applications and contribute to\npossible ethical concerns:\n\u2022 Production of high-quality text in response to human input that is\noften difficult to identify as the output of an AI (Zhang et al., 2023);\n\u2022 Ability to engage in a dialogical interaction on a very broad array of\ntopics (Gilson et al., 2023);\n\u2022 Ability to tailor its output to specific language styles (Short & Short,\n2023);\n\u2022 While currently text based, we assume that it can be integrated into\nother modalities of communication which would, for example,\nenable it to engage in voice communication (Ali et al., 2023);\n\u2022 Ability to learn from interaction leading to allow it to further\nimprove the content quality and acceptability (Sallam, 2023);\n\u2022 Based on a large language model trained on large but limited datasets\n(Radford et al., 2019).\nOne consequence of these characteristics is that interventions from\nChatGPT may be difficult to distinguish from original human in\u0002terventions. Where prior instantiations of chatbots could easily be\nidentified as such, this appears to be more difficult for ChatGPT. This\nability to interact with technology without a simple way of ascertaining\nthat it is a technology may revolutionise the way we interact with\ntechnology. We discuss the ethical issues that arise from it below, but we\nconcede that it may lead to an acceleration of research and technical\nprogress which can quickly give rise to new capabilities which can\nchange the ethical evaluation again.\nThis brings us to the question of which specific ethical benefits or\nconcerns ChatGPT are currently discussed. These are typically linked to\npossible applications. At a basic level, ChatGPT produces texts. It can\nthus potentially be applied across a vast range of applications that\ninvolve the production of text. An ethical analysis of any novel tech\u0002nology is typically well advised to look at benefits as well as concerns. At\npresent there is relatively little discussion of ethical benefits of ChatGPT,\nsuch as the potential benefits of using ChatGPT in promoting teaching\nand learning Baidoo-Anu and Owusu Ansah (2023). There is, however, a\nwide-spread perception in the media that it is likely to be disruptive and\ntransformational, which in terms of technology discourses typically\nmeans that it will lead to economic benefits, be these in the form of\nstart-up companies, optimisation of existing industries or accrual of\nfurther growth in the tech sector. Such economic growth can provide\nimproved wellbeing for many people and thus can count as a moral\nbenefit.\nKey to an ethical analysis of ChatGPT is an understanding of likely\napplications. One expectation is that ChatGPT will lead to fundamental\nchanges in the internet search sector. Google is currently the entrenched\nmarket leader in this sector. ChatGPT may change the way people\nsearch, leading to more competition in this economically highly lucra\u0002tive sector (Grant, 2023; Metz & Grant, 2023). Microsoft has already\nannounced the launch of a new and improved search engine Bing that\nwill run on ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 that they claim to be faster, more\naccurate and more capable (Mehdi, 2023). In more general terms, the\nbenefits of ChatGPT are sometimes described as providing additional\nintelligence to improve operations. One way of capturing this is the\nmetaphor of AI interns (Nast, 2023a), suggesting that it will be easier to\ndraw upon the intelligent but non-expert support that human interns can\noffer to organisations. This sounds rather incremental but given the\npotential ubiquity of the infinite number of AI interns, the cumulative\neffect may still be transformational. This may be one reason why Sam\nAltman, the CEO of Open AI can claim that he can envisage ChatGPT to\n\u201cbreak capitalism\u201d (Bove, 2023). An ethical evaluation of such a\nfundamental change of the socio-economic environment would be far\nfrom straightforward but it is easy to see how it would be beneficial for\nsome.\nWhile the moral benefits of ChatGPT thus remain somewhat fuzzy,\nthere are more clearly defined concerns. The most prominent set of those\nhas to do with the fact that ChatGPT texts can be difficult to distinguish\nfrom human output which can lead to problems of attribution of\nauthorship. This is seen as a significant problem for student assessment,\nwhere such assessment is based on essays and the fear is that students\ncan gain unfair advantages (Eke, 2023; Stokel-Walker, 2022; Weale,\n2023). Much work is undertaken to explore concerns about the role of\nChatGPT in research where it is seen as a threat to transparency in sci\u0002ence (Nature editorial, 2023). Some scientists have attempted to\npre-empt this issue by adding ChatGPT as an author to publications, but\nthe practice does not seem to find acceptance in the academic commu\u0002nity (Stokel-Walker, 2023).\nIn addition to these concerns about authorship and attribution, there\nare various other concerns that are discussed. One of these is the possible\nimpact on employment (Frederick, 2023), in particular with regards to\njobs that involve producing output that have close affinity to digital\ntechnologies, such as computer programming (Castelvecchi, 2022). As\nthe technology becomes more advanced, there is a concern that it could\nhave a significant impact on the jobs human programmers do (Marr,\n2023a).\nThe fact that the origin of a text is difficult to discern may have\nfurther morally problematic consequences. One of these is that it may\nexacerbate the widely discussed problem of misinformation and disin\u0002formation (Hsu & Thompson, 2023). Another well-established ethical\nissue of AI, namely the possibility of using it for unwarranted political\nintervention may be exacerbated by ChatGPT as highlighted by (Sanders\n& Schneier, 2023) who develop a plausible scenario of the use of chat\u0002bots for political lobbying that may overwhelm existing scrutiny\nmechanisms.\nIn addition, there is a rapidly growing number of commentaries that\npick up on other ethical concerns related to digital technologies and AI\nand that trace how these may materialise in the context of ChatGPT.\nSuch concerns include the opacity of the underlying model (van Dis\net al., 2023), environmental pollution (Nast, 2023b), the fact that\nchatbots still have no real understanding of the texts it produces (Hut\u0002son, 2021) but also the increasing affinity to the human mind which\nallows ChatGPT to pass tests designed for humans (Wilkins, 2023).\nThere is also growing evidence that to make ChatGPT more sensitive to\ncultural values and sentiments, OpenAI relied on exploited and under\u0002paid data labellers in Africa and other low-income countries (Perrigo,\n2023).\nThis list of currently discussed issues highlights key concerns that are\ncurrently discussed. This article aims to provide a more systematic and\ncomprehensive account of the ethics of ChatGPT. It therefore now in\u0002troduces the discourse on the ethics of emerging technologies, which\nwill provide the conceptual basis of the analysis and inform the meth\u0002odology that will be described in the next section.\n2.3. ChatGPT and the Ethics of Emerging Technologies\nThe previous section has shown that there is already significant\nresearch on and discussion of ethical aspects of ChatGPT. However, this\nB.C. Stahl and D. Eke\nInternational Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102700\n4\ndiscourse is mostly ad hoc and lacks a systematic approach. Much of it is\npublished in news media and focuses on specific high-profile topics. We\ntherefore suggest that a more systematic and rigorous approach to the\nethics of ChatGPT is called for that can be used to better understand\npossible issues and serve as basis for organisational and societal policy\ndevelopment. Such a more systematic approach should be based on peer\nreviewed and established knowledge that has proven to be reliable when\napplied to similar technologies. One body of knowledge and theory that\nwas developed for this very purpose is represented in the literature on\nthe ethics of emerging technologies. This article therefore draws on this\nliterature and applies it to ChatGPT. Before we outline how this can be\ndone in the methodology section, we first need to demonstrate that this\nbody of knowledge can usefully be applied to ChatGPT which requires us\nto show that ChatGPT is an emerging technology which we do by\nlooking at the components of the term, at \u2018technology\u2019 and when it can\nbe considered to be \u2018emerging\u2019.\nTechnology has its etymological root in the Greek tekhn\u00afe, which\nstands for \u201cart, skill, craft in work; method, system, an art, a system or\nmethod of making or doing\u201d and the ending \u2018-logy\u2019 which refers to\ndiscourse, theory or science which combines to the definition of tech\u0002nology as the \u201cstudy of mechanical and industrial arts\u201d (Online Ety\u0002mology Dictionary, 2022). Technology is pervasive in human societies\nand its role in shaping humans and our society has long been discussed\n(Ellul, 1973; Heidegger, 1953; Ihde, 1990; Spengler, 1931). The case of\nChatGPT shows that these questions are not just idle speculation but\naffect the way we engage with current phenomena. One can distinguish\nbetween technology as a paradigm and a device, both of which reflect an\nimportant facet of technology (Moor, 2008). An alternative catego\u0002risation distinguishes between three levels: the top level of the tech\u0002nology, which can be implemented in the meso level of different\nartefacts, which can lead to different applications at the most basic level\n(Brey, 2012). In this schema ChatGPT would be best characterised as an\nartefact which forms part of the technology of natural language pro\u0002cessing, which in turn is part of artificial intelligence, which is part of\ncomputing or digital technologies. ChatGPT forms part of the family of\nemerging digital technologies that call for ethical reflection (Kazim &\nKoshiyama, 2021). It can furthermore be seen as emerging, because it is\nstill developing fast as indicated by the transition from GPT-3 to GPT-4\n(Marr, 2023b). At the same time, the current iteration of ChatGPT is still\nvery open in terms of intended and likely applications.\nDealing with ethical questions of emerging technologies is not\nstraightforward. A key reason for this is the fundamental and unavoid\u0002able uncertainty of the future. We simply do not know with certainty\nwhat the future holds and how technology will develop (Ellul, 1973). An\nethics of emerging technologies that claims full knowledge of future\ndevelopments and their ethical consequences is thus impossible. How\u0002ever, while the future cannot be comprehensively known, it is not\nentirely unknowable either. Modern societies are based on strong as\u0002sumptions about the future (e.g. future tax revenue or demographic\ndevelopment) that allow for planning and policy development and \u2013 to\nsome degree \u2013 help pre-empt foreseeable future problems. It is this\nambiguity of future knowledge that motivates calls for research and\ntechnology development to accept partial responsibility for the ethics of\nemerging technologies (InterAcademy Partnership, 2016). This ambi\u0002guity also shapes the claims that can be raised for research on the con\u0002sequences of emerging technologies. Collingridge (1981) famously\npointed out the trade-off that short-term technical developments that we\ncan easily predict are difficult to change, whereas long-term de\u0002velopments that may be easy to steer in desired directions are difficult to\npredict (Genus & Stirling, 2018). While we thus cannot fully know the\nfuture, we can explore possible and likely futures with a view to un\u0002derstanding what they require from us today (Cuhls, 2003). Or, as\nGuston (2013) puts it, while we may not look into the future, we can\nlook toward it.\nWith these caveats in mind, it is possible to say more about the ethics\nof emerging technologies. The spirit motivating most attempts to\nundertake research on the ethics of emerging technologies is not to\nprovide scientific certainties, but to act on the insight that researchers\nshare some responsibility for future morally relevant technical de\u0002velopments and to undertake an honest attempt to proactively engage\nwith those (Cagnin et al., 2008; Groves, 2009; Swierstra et al., 2009;\nWalsham, 2012) and to provide orientation with regards to research\nactivities (van der Burg, 2014). Such an endeavour calls for intellectual\nhumility (Jasanoff, 2003) acknowledging its difficult and fallible nature\nwhich is the spirit that should inform the reading of the methodological\napproaches introduced in the next section.\n3. Methodology\nWe use the term \u2018methodology\u2019 in this paper in the commonly\naccepted meaning of \u201ca set of methods used in a particular area of study\nor activity\u201d (Cambridge Dictionary, 2023). A methodology for under\u0002taking research on the ethics of emerging technologies can be under\u0002stood as an attempt to respond to the problem of uncertainty of the\nfuture (Brooks et al., 2021). This does not mean that they can overcome\nthis problem, but they can provide a rigorous, transparent and repro\u0002ducible way of engaging with it, which allows for highlighting un\u0002certainties and calling them into question (Umbrello et al., 2023). The\nprobably most comprehensive review of ethics in research and innova\u0002tion (Reijers et al., 2018) has identified eight methods of what it calls \u201cex\nante\u201d methods, which align with the ethics of emerging technologies\ndiscussed here. A review and critique of \u201cethical foresight analysis\u201d\n(Floridi & Strait, 2020) which is similarly aligned with this article\u2019s\nresearch objective identified six existing methods, which significantly\noverlap with Reijers et al. (2018) findings. In the following subsection\nwe provide an overview of relevant methodologies that can be used to\nstudy the ethics of emerging technologies before we then explain in\ndetail our research protocol that explains how we have adapted,\ndeveloped, and implemented these for the purpose of this article.\n3.1. Methodologies for Studying the Ethics of Emerging Technologies\nMost of these methodologies aim to bridge the gap between meth\u0002odologies from future and foresight studies (Sardar, 2010) and the ethics\nof technology (Royakkers & Poel, 2011). They typically use approaches\nfrom future and foresight studies such as Delphi studies (Adler & Ziglio,\n1996; Someh et al., 2019) or scenario research (Gray & Hovav, 2007)\nand put special emphasis on questions of ethics.\nThis article employs a sub-set of the established methodologies of\nresearch on the ethics of emerging technologies, notably the subset that\nallows for the identification of ethical issues. Much effort across various\nmethodologies is expended on identifying emerging technologies. This\nwork is not needed in this article because it focuses on a defined tech\u0002nology, namely ChatGPT. Furthermore, the article\u2019s aim is to broaden\nawareness of the ethics benefits and challenges raised by ChatGPT, i.e.,\nit aims to enumerate such issues in as comprehensive a manner as\npossible. It therefore does not need to pay attention to what is typically\nthe next step proposed by several of the methodologies, which is the\nquestion of how to address them.\nThe methodology employed in this article is therefore based on three\nof the established methodologies of ethics of emerging technologies that\ninclude proposals for identifying ethical issues. This is complemented by\nsteps that undertake a similar approach in the ethics of artificial intel\u0002ligence (AI). The three methodologies used here are referred to as\n\u201canticipatory technology ethics\u201d (ATE, (Brey, 2012)), the \u201cframework\nfor the ethical impact assessment of information technology\u201d (EIA,\n(Wright, 2011)) and \u201cethical issues of emerging ICT applications\u201d\n(ETICA, (Stahl, 2011; Stahl et al., 2017). These three were all developed\nin the early 2010 s. They are aware of each other and mutually cite one\nanother. This can serve as an indicator that combining them, as is pro\u0002posed in this article, is a legitimate activity. They also take a similar\napproach to the identification of issues which is the core interest in this\nB.C. Stahl and D. Eke\nInternational Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102700\n5\narticle.\nAll three agree that ethical concerns do not arise in a vacuum and\nthat one can learn about likely future ones by looking at established\nethical discussions and by asking which established issues are likely to\nbe relevant in a novel technology or application area and how such is\u0002sues can be categorised. They each produce a list of issues which shows\nsignificant overlap. They differ in how these lists are constructed. ATE\u2019s\nlist is derived from philosophical ethics of technology and has the main\ncategories of harms and risks, rights, (distributive) justice, and well\u0002being and the common good. In each of these categories a number of\nissues are located. In some cases these issues are then subdivided further.\nFor example, under rights there is the issue of freedom, which is broken\ndown in freedom of movement, speech and assembly. EIA starts with its\nmain categories by using the principles of biomedical ethics (Beauchamp\n& Childress, 2009): autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and jus\u0002tice. These are complemented by the category of privacy and data pro\u0002tection. Again, each of these have a number of issues associated with\neach of the categories. For each of the issues (or in some case values),\nEIA offers a number of questions that support the reflection of the issues\nin a specific context. The ETICA method, final, offers a similar list of\nissues. However, the individual issues were arrived at differently. They\nwere identified on the basis of the analyses of 10 different emerging\ntechnologies and the categories were constructed in a bottom-up\nmanner. The categories listed in (Stahl et al., 2017) are: conceptual is\u0002sues and ethical theories, impact on individuals, consequences for so\u0002ciety, uncertainty of outcomes, perceptions of technologies and role of\nhumans. In this methodology each of the categories or issues are also\nlinked to guiding questions that are meant to help researchers under\u0002stand and identify the nature of the potential ethical concern.\nThe aspect of these three approaches to the ethics of emerging\ntechnologies that is of most interest to this article is the list of likely\nissues they produced. For the purposes of this article the idea was to\ngenerate the most comprehensive overview of possible issues to then\ninterrogate this list with a view to identifying issues related to ChatGPT\nthat are most in need of discussion. The lists provided by the three\nmethodologies were therefore merged into one list. For this purpose, the\nlists were reduced to a one-dimensional list, i.e., the categories and, in\nthe case of ATE, the sub-issues, were either included, where they offered\nadditional insights, or excluded, if they were covered by the issues.\nAdditional information, notably the guiding questions from EIA and\nETICA were retained as comments linked to the issues to guide the more\ndetailed subsequent analysis steps. The table in appendix A contains the\nlist of all the issues as identified across the three methodologies.\nThis list of issues in appendix A provides the basis of the analysis of\nthe ethical issues of ChatGPT undertaken for this article. They represent\nthe ethical issues identified by the three methodologies and need to be\nread in conjunction with the supporting documentation, notably the\ndefinitions of the issues and the guiding questions accompanying them.\nWe believe that they constitute a good starting point for an analysis of\nthe ethics of emerging technologies. However, we realise that this list of\nissues dates back to the early 2010 s and was not specifically compiled\nwith a view to AI. In light of the rapid development of AI and the dis\u0002cussion of the ethics of AI in the intervening years, we decided to cali\u0002brate this list by adding a set of issues that were identified specifically\nwith AI in mind. As ChatGPT is an example of an AI application, we\naimed to ensure that established ethical concerns arising from the ethics\nof AI discourse were properly included.\nThe inclusion of the ethics of AI raised further methodological\nquestions. While there is a relatively settled landscape of research on the\nethics of emerging technologies as outlined above, the same cannot be\nsaid about the ethics of AI (Ashok et al., 2022; Dwivedi et al., 2019). This\ndiscourse continues to mushroom. It has a strong emphasis on ethical\nguidelines and principles (Fjeld et al., 2020; Jobin et al., 2019) which\nincludes a number of high profile interventions (AI HLEG, 2019) but it\nalso legislation such as the EU\u2019s AI Act (European Commission, 2021),\nvarious approaches to standardisation (IEEE, 2017; NIST, 2022),\ncertification and many others. There are several attempts to identify and\ncategorise AI-specific ethical issues, e.g. by M\u00fcller (2020) who distin\u0002guishes between ethical issues of AI systems as objects which includes\nprivacy, manipulation, opacity, bias, human-robot interaction,\nemployment, and the effects of autonomy and ethical issues of AI sys\u0002tems as subjects which include machine ethics, artificial moral agency,\nand finally the issues arising from an AI superintelligence. Vesnic-Alu\u0002jevic et al. (2020) distinguish between individual issues which includes\nautonomy, dignity, privacy and data protection, and societal issues\nwhich includes fairness and equity; the good life and diversity; re\u0002sponsibility and accountability; transparency; surveillance and data\u0002fication; governance of the AI.\nThese examples demonstrate that there is significant overlap be\u0002tween the ethics of emerging technologies and the ethics of AI which is\nnot surprising, as AI can still be considered an emerging technology. It\nraises the question, however, which list to include in our analysis to\navoid possible blind spots. We decided to include a list published by the\nEuropean Parliament (2020) which was compiled by a group of aca\u0002demics with a view to providing broad coverage of issues of interest to\nthe European Parliament and hence, by implication, to European citi\u0002zens. This list is categorised in terms of AI impact on different aspects of\nsociety where individual issues are then listed as shown in Appendix B\nbelow.\n3.2. Research protocol\nIn our research we based the analysis of ChatGPT on the list of issues\nthat are displayed in Appendix A and B. These formed the theoretically\nderived starting point for us to explore possible ethical issues. We used\nthese lists of ethical issues as shown in appendices A and B to find out\nwhat we can learn about the ethical benefits and challenges raised by\nChatGPT by applying existing approaches to the ethics of emerging\ndigital technologies. In order to achieve this, we combined the lists of\nissues into one spreadsheet which also included the guiding questions\nfrom EIA and ETICA to help us understand the issues in more detail. We\nthen wanted to explore whether ChatGPT is likely to have an impact on\nthe various issues. For each issue we therefore explored how ChatGPT\nmight impact it, both in positive and negative terms. This was done by\nproviding a short narrative outlining our reasoning and then allocating a\nlikelihood of this impact arising (1 =low, 2 =medium, 3 =high) and a\nmeasure of severity (1 =low impact, 2 =medium impact, 3 =high\nimpact). This allowed us to calculate an expected impact measure,\nseparated between positive and negative impacts, which we arrived at\nby multiplying likelihood and severity, giving us two scores between 1\nand 9 (one for benefits, one for damages) for each of the issues. To allow\nfor independent scrutiny of our approach, we make the full spreadsheet\nincluding the narrative justifications and the scores for each issue we\nmake the complete spreadsheet available here.1\nA key challenge when using this approach was to identify likely areas\nand mechanisms of impact. Our aim was to offer an analysis of ethical\nissues of ChatGPT that cuts across application areas. However, the\nnumber of possible applications is close to infinite, and we may not be\naware of some that are already being worked on, even less of ones that\nare currently unexplored. We therefore focused on the key ethically\nrelevant features of ChatGPT, namely its abilities to produce text that is\ndifficult to recognise as machine-generated, its ability to learn and\ninteract seamlessly with humans. In order to provide plausibility of our\nevaluations we used the narrative part of the analysis to indicate which\napplication examples we had in mind before scoring them. Furthermore,\nin order to provide some rigour to the analysis the two authors co\u0002reviewed each other\u2019s analysis to ensure consistency and plausibility.\nAs all future and foresight research methods, this methodological\napproach does not promise scientific exactness. Its purpose is to surface\n1 https://tinyurl.com/5fawk8yc\nB.C. Stahl and D. Eke\nInternational Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102700\n6\npossible issues, in particular those that have not yet been looked at in\nmuch detail and to do so in a systematic and transparent way. We un\u0002derstand that our analysis is somewhat idiosyncratic and driven by our\nprior knowledge in particular our understanding of ethics of technology\nand that researchers with different backgrounds might highlight other\nissues and use different justifications for this. From our perspective this\nis not majorly problematic, and we would indeed welcome alternative\nvoices that come to different conclusions from ours, as it would\nstrengthen the overall aim of the exercise which is to support a public\ndiscourse on the ethical issues of ChatGPT.\nAs a final remark on the article\u2019s methodology, we would like to\nhighlight that we interacted with ChatGPT during the writing of this\narticle and incorporated some of the insights into the narrative. As the\nuse of ChatGPT in academia is currently highly contested and at the\ncentre of public attention, we chose to collect all of our relevant in\u0002teractions with the system and make them accessible to scrutiny on this\ndocument.2\n4. Findings and discussion\nBy following the methodology described above, we aimed to arrive at\na comprehensive understanding of the ethics of ChatGPT that is trans\u0002parent and rigorous. However, when implementing the method, we had\nto make assumptions and choices that are relevant to the analysis and\nneed to be highlighted. When assessing the likelihood and severity of\nboth positive and negative impacts, we had to make use of our under\u0002standing and possible scenarios of use. We only considered immediate\nconsequences based on the core characteristics and capability of\nChatGPT, i.e., its abilities to produce text that is difficult to recognise as\nmachine-generated, its ability to learn and interact seamlessly with\nhumans. For example, we assumed that it can be used for telephone\nconversations where the respondent is not aware of speaking to a ma\u0002chine. This, in turn can be used for data collection, which may have for\nlegitimate and illegitimate purposes, such as online or telephone mar\u0002keting but also social engineering or political persuasion. Our key\nchallenge was to use a consistent boundary of future exploration which\nis anchored in the actual technical capability of ChatGPT and avoid\ngeneral speculation. Where possible and relevant we therefore used the\ntextual description of benefits and risks to explain how we arrived at our\nevaluation of the various issues.\nIn order to allow for a general overview and comparability of ben\u0002efits and risks we used a simple method of quantifying these, providing\nmeasures of likelihood and impact. We use these measures for the dis\u0002cussion below, as they allowed us to highlight what we perceive to be\nkey topics worthy of attention. We believe that this is a reasonable\napproach that mirrors widely used ways of dealing with risks and ben\u0002efits of emerging technology through risk management or impact as\u0002sessments processes (Stahl, Antoniou et al., 2023). We fully realise,\nhowever, that the numerical scores we allocated are expressions of our\ninterpretations rather than objective truths. Before we return to the\nreflection on and evaluation of our approach, let us take a look at what\nthe analysis unearthed.\n4.1. Benefits and concerns of ChatGPT\nOne intention behind this article was to arrive at a balanced view of\nChatGPT that takes into account both benefits and concerns linked to the\ntechnology. We therefore start the discussion of our substantive findings\nby looking at the concepts that promised benefits that scored highest.\nWe evaluated the following concepts as having a high likelihood of being\nrealised and a high level of social or ethical benefit: collective human\nidentity and the good life; perceptions of technology, the role of humans,\nbeneficence, sustainability, health and bodily harm, the ability to think\none\u2019s own thoughts and form one\u2019s own opinions, animal rights and\nanimal welfare, support of vital social institutions and structures, the\nlabour market, and impact on the financial system. This very eclectic\ngroup of benefits is defined by its broad scope and reach. These are not\nspecific issues or topics but mostly comprised of higher-level aggregate\nconcepts. Human identity, the role of humans, beneficence, the labour\nmarket, the financial system or health are all high-level topics that\ndepend on the collaboration of many individuals across large parts of\nsociety. This implies that they rely heavily on successful communication\nbetween different types of stakeholders. Such communication and the\ntranslation of meaning across different vocabularies of different stake\u0002holder groups is something that is core to the capabilities of ChatGPT.\nBeing high-level, these concepts also are open to interpretation and offer\nscope for the analyst to fill them with life.\nWe identified 11 concepts that scored the maximum in terms of\nbenefits. The above benefits are highlighted in literature on how\nChatGPT and other generative AI systems can be leveraged in hospitality\nand tourism industry (Dwivedi, Pandey et al., 2023), in healthcare\n(Javaid et al., 2023), in transportation (Du et al., 2023), and agriculture\n(Ray, 2023). In contrasts with the benefits, we identified 30 concepts\nthat scored the maximum (i.e. were deemed to have a high likelihood of\nmaterialising and a high impact) in terms of negative impact. These can\nbe grouped as issues related to social justice and rights, individual needs,\nculture and identity as well as environmental impacts as shown in Fig. 1.\nThis figure suggests that the key issues that have the potential to raise\nthe most significant concerns can be divided into four main categories.\nThese are social justice and rights where ChatGPT is seen as having a\npotentially detrimental effect on the moral underpinnings of society,\nsuch as a shared view of justice and fair distribution as well as specific\nsocial concerns such as digital divides or social exclusion. The second\ngroup pertains to individual needs, such as safety and autonomy which\nare also reflected in informed consent and the avoidance of harm. We\nincluded environmental harms as one group of issues and added topics\nof culture and identity as a fourth group. This categorisation is one of\nmany possible ones. The dividing lines are not as clear-cut as the figure\nmay suggest. Some of the issues could fit into more than one of the\nboxes. Its main purpose here is to show the breadth of issues and con\u0002cerns which cover pretty much any aspect of life.\nA further perspective on our analysis that may be helpful with\nregards to identifying key ethical concerns worthy of further study and\nintervention is provided by the difference between benefits and down\u0002sides. We calculated the total impact by subtracting the total negative\nimpact (probability times damage) from the positive impact (probability\ntimes benefit). The total impact score is positive if the positive impact\noutweighs the negative impact. The higher the score, the more the\nbenefits outweigh risks and the reverse is true for negative impacts.\nA look at the net positive concepts shows that these are mostly linked\nto the external world, such as with regards to the rights of animals\n(which could be promoted) or the promotion of physical health (which\ncould benefit from telemedicine, clinical decision support, disease sur\u0002veillance etc.) In all of these cases ChatGPT has the potential to improve\nprocesses. As a language-based system, ChatGPT can have negative\nimpacts in these areas as well, but these would not be immediate, as they\nmight be in the case of robotic systems, and we felt that on the balance of\nprobability, the positives would dominate the negatives in these cases.\nOn the other end of the scale, we have those concepts that promise a\nhigher negative than positive impact. Many of these are related to the\nchanges in social relationships that ChatGPT may engender. This in\u0002cludes questions of responsibility and accountability where there is no\ndoubt a possibility that a better way of understanding complex situa\u0002tions may help and the ability to generate texts may strengthen re\u0002sponsibility and accountability regimes. However, we felt that the much\nmore likely consequences of ChatGPT use will be that strong agents can\nuse the technology to obfuscate and confuse public discourse with a\nview to evading responsibility and being held accountable.\nFurther broad issues having to do with social relationships follow a 2 https://tinyurl.com/yuk4w2yk\nB.C. Stahl and D. Eke\nInternational Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102700\n7\nsimilar logic. We included social solidarity, inclusion and exclusion,\nintergenerational justice, biases and digital divides in the same category.\nIn all of these cases it is perfectly plausible that ChatGPT will do good\nand help those who are disenfranchised to gain a voice. But in practice\nand based on past experience in the way emerging digital unfold in\nwestern society, we assume that the negative implications will vastly\novershadow the positive ones. The divides between those who have\naccess to ChatGPT and are able to leverage it and those who do not will\nlikely follow similar lines as existing digital and social divides and the\nones who will be able to draw most benefit will continue to be the ones\nwho are advantaged already, i.e. the large companies who have the\nresources to make use of new technologies and the individuals who have\nthe education, financial and intellectual independence to understand the\nopportunities and realise them.\n4.2. Relevance of the findings\nThe objective of this article is to explore ethical benefits and chal\u0002lenges raised by ChatGPT by applying existing approaches to the ethics\nof emerging digital technologies. A key question in assessing the value\nand contribution of the article is the degree to which it corresponds or\ncontradicts existing scholarship. It is therefore worth comparing our\nfindings with the current discourse on the ethics of ChatGPT.\nDue to the novelty of the technology, there is relatively little aca\u0002demic and peer-reviewed work on the topic available, even though the\nnumber of articles is growing rapidly. At the time of writing a search of\nthe Scopus research databased using the search string \u201cethics AND\nChatGPT\u201d returns 25 results. At present the academic literature focuses\non the set of topic that are prominent in the public domain and media\nthat was discussed earlier. A key topic is that of authorship and the in\u0002fluence of ChatGPT on research and education (Lee, 2023; Salvagno\net al., 2023), a topic that our analysis is sensitive to. There are contri\u0002butions that aim to capture a broader set of issues such as Dwivedi,\nKshetri et al. (2023) including ethical concerns but they remain rela\u0002tively superficial.\nOne way of assessing whether our approach meets the objective of\nproviding a rigorous and comprehensive account of ethical aspects of\nChatGPT is successful is to explore whether it reflects and is consistent\nwith recent scholarship. There is currently much work that aims to\nprovide guidance on the use of ChatGPT in the academic publication\nsystem. A good example is provided by Shmueli et al. (2023) who\nexplore how authors, reviewers and editors in data science can\nresponsibly leverage and address challenges of using generative AI tools\nlike ChatGPT to improve scholarship. The editorial covers ethical issues\naround authorship, accountability, methodological rigor, bias, fairness,\naccuracy, gaming the system, privacy, data exposure, interpretability,\nintellectual property, availability, review reliability, and responsible use\nas ethical issues arising from the application of generative AI like\nChatGPT in data science research and publishing. All of these concerns\ncan be located in our ethical analysis as well. Another recent example of\nengagement with ethics of ChatGPT is given by Susarla et al. (2023) who\ndiscuss guidelines and challenges for the responsible use of generative AI\nlike ChatGPT in IS research, including concerns around bias, account\u0002ability, intellectual property, and depth versus potential benefits for\nproblem formulation, data analysis, and writing. Again, these concerns\nare well covered by our analysis. As a final indication whether our\nanalysis is relevant to the current discussion of ChatGPT, it is worth\nlooking at a publication that is not primarily interested in ethical\nFig. 1. Ethical issues with highest negative impacts of ChatGPT.\nB.C. Stahl and D. Eke\nInternational Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102700\n8\nquestions. Dwivedi et al. (2023) explore practices, challenges, and a\nresearch agenda for implementing generative AI tools like ChatGPT in\nthe hospitality and tourism industry. While not focused on ethics, the\npaper acknowledges ChatGPT raises important ethical issues around\nprivacy, bias, transparency, governance, labour impacts etc. that require\nthoughtful policies and practices by users. By referring to these three\npublications we can confirm that our analysis engages with the ethical\nissues that are currently discussed and that it has a broader scope than\nthe current discourse.\nIn addition to the current general discussion, it is worth looking more\nspecifically at the way in which the community of scholars working on\nlarge language models are perceiving the issues arising from the class of\ntechnologies that includes ChatGPT. The most prominent contribution\nto this discourse comes from the Google-owned AI company DeepMind\n(Weidinger et al., 2021). In their report they report a total of 21 risks of\nharm that can be expected from language models, categorised in the\nfollowing six risk areas: I. Discrimination, Exclusion and Toxicity, II.\nInformation Hazards, III., Misinformation Harms, IV. Malicious Uses, V.\nHuman-Computer Interaction Harms, VI. Automation, Access, and\nEnvironmental Harms. The report does not provide a detailed method\u0002ology of how the risks were identified which makes a detailed com\u0002parison with the ethical issues derived from the emerging technology\nliterature difficult. However, there is significant similarity and overlap\nbetween the 21 risks identified by Weidinger et al. (2021) and the issues\nthat we list in the appendix.\nMaybe even more interesting than the general issues related to lan\u0002guage models is the observation of how OpenAI is currently engaging\nwith the ethical issues of ChatGPT. While we were writing this article,\nOpenAI launched GPT-4, the next version of the language model that\nChatGPT is based on. As part of this launch the company published a\ntechnical report (OpenAI, 2023b) and a \u201csystem card\u201d document\n(OpenAI, 2023a). These documents provide some technical background\nto GPT-4 that allows an insight into the ethical issues that OpenAI has\nrecognised and is attempting to address in the development of GPT-4.\nBoth documents contain an identical figure (OpenAI, 2023a, p. 8)\nshowing example prompts (i.e. input from external users) and the\nresponse of an earlier version and how GPT-4 responds when it was\nlaunched. The prompts covered in the table refer to ethically problem\u0002atic information that ChatGPT could conceivably provide, including\nadvice on immoral activities such as murder, production of weapons,\nmoney laundering, self-harm, threats, racism and purchase of weapons.\nIn an earlier version GPT-4 provided responses to these prompts whereas\nthe launched version refuses to provide input. When tested in April\n2023, ChatGPT gave similar answers to the launch version of GPT-4,\nsuggesting that these safeguards had already been implemented. All of\nthese issues that OpenAI is addressing in GPT-4 are part of or implied in\nthe list of issues we identified in our methodology, thus confirming that\nour ethical analysis is valid. We thus think there is evidence that our\nresearch objective was met and that the approach we offer in this article\nis rigorous and comprehensive. Despite this success in moving towards\nour research objective, open questions remain.\n4.3. Open questions\nWhile we believe that our analysis is valid, robust and transparent,\nwe do not claim that it is exclusive. By this we mean that others who\nwould follow the same methodology could plausibly come to different\ninsights. The value of doing the analysis is not so much in the substantive\nitems and concerns that we have looked at but in the deeper under\u0002standing of the overall landscape of ChatGPT use that it provides. By\nundertaking the analysis, we have come to a better understanding of\nhow ethical issues of ChatGPT are conceptualised and framed in public\ndiscourse which raises questions that need to be discussed for reasonable\nand realistic responses to emerge.\nOne key question that pervades many of the issues and is highly\nrelevant to the evaluation of ethical issues is that of ownership and\ncontrol of use. In our analysis we have assumed that ChatGPT will be\nfreely available to all possible users. This is the model that OpenAI has\nchosen to initially bring to potential users, and it is consistent with ac\u0002cess models of other types of general digital technologies, such as pop\u0002ular search engines. However, it is far from obvious whether this will\nremain the case. If benefits of ChatGPT can be monetised, then this is\nlikely to happen. A paid-for version called ChatGPT plus already exists\nwhich requires a monthly payment of US$20 and has a more advanced\narchitecture, is based on more training data and likely better perfor\u0002mance (Salunke, 2023). Open AI which started out as non-profit orga\u0002nisation created a capped-profit subsidiary, ostensibly with a view of\nallowing employee share options. The non-profit OpenAI Inc is the\ncontrolling shareholder of the for-profit OpenAI LP which may provide\nan avenue for continuation of the organisation\u2019s aim of democratising QI\n(\u201cOpenAI, 2023c). However, there have been some high-profile links to\ncorporate players, notably a partnership with Microsoft which is using\nOpenAI technology for its chat business which have been critically\nevaluated by some observers (Xiang, 2023). It is not the purpose of this\narticle to discuss corporate structures of OpenAI, but it seems likely that\nthese corporate structures will have an influence on the ethical issues\nrelated to ChatGPT. As we have seen, many of the key ethical concerns\ninvolve broader question of social cohesion, inclusion and exclusion.\nProfit-oriented ownership of technology has been described as a key\nconcern of other technologies (Zuboff, 2019) and ChatGPT is likely to be\ncovered by these concerns.\nWhere profit is the driver of the organisations that develop and make\navailable ChatGPT and related technologies, it is easy to foresee that\nprofitable applications will be privileged over non-profitable ones. This\nmeans that many of the benefits that we identified, those that will allow\nunderserved communities to strengthen their position and make their\nvoices heard, are less likely to be supported than those that promise a\nreturn on investment.\nA further open question that has some link to ownership but also to\nthe broader social context of ChatGPT is that of governance and over\u0002sight, in particular with regards to misuse of the technology. This raises\ndifficult questions of what would count as use or misuse, e.g. in fields\nlike the persuasion of voters to vote for a particular party or of customers\nto buy products. These may well be deemed legitimate uses by some but\nmisuse by others. However, there are more clear-cut cases of misuse,\nnotably the use of ChatGPT for illegal purposes such as scamming, fraud\netc. The capabilities of ChatGPT clearly render it a useful tool for such\nillegal uses, a point that is already well recognised (Europol, 2023;\nSweney, 2023). The current technical and organisational model where\nChatGPT is hosted centrally and allows for interactions via the web may\noffer mechanisms for tracing illegal uses and countering them. If and\nwhen ChatGPT or its successors or competitors become available as\nstand-alone systems, this may open additional avenues for illegal use.\nThe ownership model is also likely to have implications for the\nbroader understanding of the technology and thus of its robustness and\nreliability. In our analysis of the different ethical issues, we assumed that\nChatGPT can provide human-like input into conversations with a high\nlevel of reliability. However, there is the well-discussed issue that ma\u0002chine learning models can learn biases from its training data and\nreplicate these in interactions with users. This has been a key short\u0002coming of previous models such as Microsoft\u2019s chatbot Tay (Wolf et al.,\n2017). OpenAI seems to have spent considerable effort in avoiding\nChatGPT from generating racist or similarly offensive output, but it is\nopen to which degree this will remain successful. A related challenge in\nterms of reliability and robustness of the technology is the transparency\nof its sources and outputs comes from the technology\u2019s propensity to\n\u201challucinate\u201d. This term refers to mistakes that ChatGPT makes when\ngenerating text that is semantically correct but factually incorrect or\neven nonsensical (Smith, 2023). Such hallucinations are a general\nproblem for ChatGPT but depending on the context of their occurrence\ncould raise significant ethical problems, for example in healthcare\nsettings.\nB.C. Stahl and D. Eke\nInternational Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102700\n9\nIn addition to these questions that are focused on the technology\nitself and the way people can interact with it, there are further open\nquestions about how a long-term use of this type of technology changes\nour collective view of what it means to be human and to interact with\ntechnology. We posit in this article that one of the crucial features of\nChatGPT is its ability to produce human-like texts which implies that it\nmay be difficult to assess whether a contribution to a conversation\ncomes from a human or a machine. This is traditionally seen as prob\u0002lematic, as we assume that interactions between humans and machines\nand among humans differ. The European General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR, 2016) stipulates in Article 22 that any data subject\n\u201cshall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on\nautomated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects\nconcerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her.\u201d This\ncould be read as implying that many interactions with chatbots will have\nto be flagged as such. What is unclear, however, is whether and how long\nthis position will be upheld. If ChatGPT paves the way for widespread\nuse of chatbots for all sorts of purposes, then it may well be that our\nmoral preferences change and the distinction between interacting with a\nhuman and a machine are seen as decreasingly crucial. The opposite\ndevelopment is also conceivable, where more emphasis will be put on\nthe identification of artificial agents in conversations.\nIn the longer term these developments can also touch on the broader\nethical questions of the impact of artificial general intelligence, a highly\ncontested term (Mitchell, 2019) but one that OpenAI openly promotes.\nThis points to larger philosophical question around the nature of reality\nand how AI can change our view of it, which are beyond the scope of this\narticle that focuses on immediate capabilities and impacts of ChatGPT\nbut which may well turn out to be the most significant ethical implica\u0002tions of ChatGPT.\nAt a philosophical level, there is also the open question of whether\nChatGPT\u2019s ability to produce humanlike responses affirms Jacques\nDerrida\u2019s critique of logocentrism of giving privileges to speech over\nwriting. Derrida\u2019s position was that meaning in natural language is\ndetermined by the \u2018play\u2019 of differences between words and not by ideas\nand intentions of a speaker (Sallis, 1987). There is no reason therefore to\nconsider that speech comes before writing. For some, it may be taken\nthat ChatGPT \u2018writes without speech\u2019. If this is true, it confirms Derrida\u2019s\nposition that there is a disconnect between the living voice of the\nspeaker and written words. However, does ChatGPT write without\nspeech? Or it is trained on living voices of many speakers and subse\u0002quently predicts patterns of words? Does ChatGPT \u2018write\u2019 without\nspeech or \u2018predicts\u2019 from living voices? This is an open question that\nrequires more thought and research.\n5. Implications\nThe analysis of the ethical issues of ChatGPT has implications for\nresearch as well as practice that are spelled out below.\n5.1. Implications for research\nThe article has demonstrated that a rigorous and comprehensive\napproach to the ethics of ChatGPT is possible and that existing meth\u0002odologies can be used to gain an overview of the ethical issues. At the\nsame time, the previous section on open questions has given an indi\u0002cation of avenues for further research that can be pursued to further\nstrengthen the approach and go beyond it.\nAn initial limitation of the present research is that it was undertaken\nby the authors of the paper which allowed for a controlled analysis of\nethical issues but is limited by the worldviews and experiences of the\nresearchers. Undertaking a similar study using the ethics of emerging\ntechnologies but broadening expected benefits and concerns by\nincluding more stakeholders will very likely bring to light further in\u0002sights that would likely change the evaluation of benefits and risks.\nAnother avenue of further research would be to undertake a direct\ncomparison with between the abstract analysis of ethical aspects offered\nhere and the specific work that is already undertaken by the owners and\ndevelopers of ChatGPT and other large language models. The previous\nsection suggests that these questions are taken seriously by developers\nbut that work on ethical issues is focused on immediate harm and its\navoidance, thus excluding many of the broader issues such as fairness,\ninclusion, access, labour markets etc. Furthermore, research appears to\nfocus heavily on ethical concerns and tends not to be explicit about the\ndifficult process of comparing and balancing benefits and concerns.\nFuture studies will furthermore be called for to better understand\ndetailed empirical impacts of ChatGPT. In this paper we focused on the\ngeneric characteristics of the technology and inferred possible uses and\nconsequences from those characteristics. A more detailed understanding\nwould be gained by a differentiated analysis looking at specific appli\u0002cation areas or industries. Such detailed analysis would also help\nresearch keep abreast of the rapidly developing technical landscape and\nthe capability of large language models. This question of technical\ndevelopment is also likely to have implications for the more abstract\nquestions around the potential for the development of AGI or other long\u0002term philosophical questions. It is likely that such questions will not be\nconfined to ChatGPT or large language models but need to include other\ndevelopments of AI and its enabling technologies. Elsewhere we have\nsuggested that a suitable way of framing such research is to explore the\nethics of the socio-technical innovation ecosystem in which AI is realised\n(Stahl, 2022, 2023). This perspective is important when determining the\nimplications of ChatGPT because it shifts the focus from individuals (e.g.\ndevelopers or users) or organisations (notably OpenAI) to the broader\necosystem (Chae, 2019; Senyo et al., 2019). The question of who is\nresponsible for specific ethical consequences then transforms into the\nquestion of how should the ecosystem be structured to promote bene\u0002ficial and prevent detrimental effects of the technology.\nThe key implication for research is thus that further research is called\nfor. While this is a typical and often self-serving position taken in many\nresearch publications, its relevance and legitimacy in the case of\nChatGPT is hard to deny. The potential impact of the technology com\u0002bined with its rapidly evolving nature combine into a strong argument\nfor ongoing research-based reflection of its ethical implications. Such\nresearch is in the public interest but also in the interest of the AI industry\nand forms part of the implications for practice.\n5.2. Implications for practice\nThe insights developed in this paper and the availability of a more\ncomprehensive overview of ethical concerns related to ChatGPT are\nrelevant to the practice of several stakeholder groups including policy\u0002makers, research funders and companies developing or using large\nlanguage models.\nOne can observe a rapidly growing recognition among policymakers\nthat the nature of recent AI developments is such that a passive approach\nto legislation and regulation is difficult to justify. While some regulatory\ndevelopments such as the EU AI Act precede the arrival of ChatGPT, one\ncan argue that ChatGPT has contributed to the push for the need of\npolicy intervention, notably in the USA. It is now broadly recognised\nthat policy initiatives, potentially including legislation, regulation or the\ncreation of new regulators (Graham & Warren, 2023) is required to\nensure responsible development and use of generative AI. Such initia\u0002tives may be called for to mitigate impacts, for example where harm\narises due to job losses, inequality, social biases and mitigate identified\nharms. These are not fundamentally new insights (Executive Office of\nthe President, 2016), but the arrival of ChatGPT has highlighted the\nneed for such interventions.\nThe insights arising from this paper show that at present there is a\nlack of balance between the attention paid to ethical benefits and\ndownsides of ChatGPT. Relevant policy should pay attention to both of\nthese aspects as well as to the question who receives the benefits and\nwho is exposed to the downsides. This implies that policies are called for\nB.C. Stahl and D. Eke\nInternational Journal of Information Management 74 (2024) 102700\n10\nthat promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in access to generative AI\nto prevent exacerbating divides. This may include subsidies or public\naccess programmes. Policy can be used to create incentives through\ngovernment procurement practices, grants etc. to steer development\ntowards social good applications. ChatGPT and related technologies are\nnot locally bound with risks and benefits potentially having global\nreach. This means that any relevant policy intervention needs to move\nbeyond the local and national level and establish reliable policy\nframeworks on the international level (UNESCO, 2022; Wallach &\nMarchant, 2018). Some of the ethical issues point to the fundamental\nstructures of our societies. ChatGPT arises from the current context of\nwhat Zuboff (2019) calls surveillance capitalism. A long-lasting response\nto the ethics of ChatGPT may well call for fundamental reconsiderations\nof the structure of current socio-economic systems.\nSome of the more immediate implications of our research arise for\nresearch funders. The objective of our research was to come to a more\ncomprehensive understanding of the ethical issues of ChatGPT. The\nfollow-on research activities outlined in the implications for research\nwill need to be funded. This not only includes the broadening of the\nresearch by involving stakeholder perspectives but also research on\npossible and likely mitigation measures. These can range from the use of\nopen, transparent and unbiased foundations for generative models that\ncan overcome some of the limitations of proprietary systems. Key to the\nsuccess of engaging with ethics of ChatGPT will be to bring in diverse\nperspectives which may call for funding to support diverse participation\nin generative AI development and preventing homogeneous thinking.\nThis calls for interdisciplinary research that can inform educational\ninitiatives to develop expert and public understanding of responsible\ndevelopment and use. The broadening of the discourse furthermore calls\nfor stronger interdisciplinary collaboration.\nPolicy and funding support will only have a chance of promoting\nethically beneficial outcomes of ChatGPT use, if the organisations\ndriving the development of large language models actively engage with\nethical questions. Implications for industry thus include a need to pri\u0002oritise ethical considerations early, e.g. through ethical review boards\nand risk assessment processes. Responsible design principles that are\nbeing developed across the AI landscape like transparency, account\u0002ability and bias testing should become standard in training generative AI\nmodels. Companies should consider the use of impact assessment\nmethods (Stahl et al., 2023) prior to deploying their technologies. It is\nlikely that a risk-based approach will be applied to AI (NIST, 2022) and\ncompanies need to consider how high risk applications of large language\nmodels can be governed. But even for lower risk applications, the bal\u0002ance of benefits and concerns should be considered. This is likely to call\nfor companies to develop access and pricing models that prevent the\nexclusion of typically underserved communities, to allow them to\nbenefit from large language models.\nIn developing appropriate responses, companies need to work with\ngovernments, regulators and policymakers. This certainly appears to be\nhappening at present where OpenAI and other large tech companies are\nworking with the US legislature and executive to address concerns\naround AI. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the oligopo\u0002listic structure of the tech industry is part of the underlying problem and\nthe leading companies in this space are unlikely to wish to change the\nstructure that they benefit from. Furthermore, companies will focus on\nthose markets that are most profitable for them, thus leading to limits to\ninternational collaboration and exacerbating the risk that the downsides\nof new technologies will be pushed into areas where they do not have\ntheir economic focus.\nIt would thus be na\u00efve to expect industry to solve these issues, but at\nthe same time, they will not be solved without the contribution of in\u0002dustry. A public commitment of the tech giants stating that they have\nethical duties arising from the products they distribute cannot replace\nstronger regulatory interventions, but it can serve as a useful reminder in\ncontroversial debates that at least some companies accept that they have\nethical commitments beyond the maximisation of profits and that they\nrecognise their social responsibilities.\n6. Conclusion\nThis article explores the ethical issues raised by ChatGPT beyond\ncurrent debates on authorship, demonstrating the value of applying\nexisting approaches to the ethics of emerging technologies. Our analysis\nhighlights a broad range of relevant ethical concerns going significantly\nbeyond the current discourse. This is useful for AI ethics scholars, de\u0002velopers, and anyone interested in suitable ethics methodologies. The\nanalysis also provides insights into implications and interventions,\nemphasizing the need to consider the whole socio-technical AI\necosystem, not just specific issues. Fully addressing the challenges will\nlikely require multi-level societal engagement, from individual software\nengineers to international policies, to ensure the benefits of AI, in\nparticular large language models such as those underpinning ChatGPT,\nare realized while harms are avoided. Overall, the article advocates\napplying a holistic ethics perspective to guide ongoing discourse and\naction around such impactful emerging technologies.\nResponsible innovation ecosystems\nEthical implications of the application of the ecosystem concept to\nartificial intelligence.\nFunding source\nThis research was funded by the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020\nResearch and Innovation Programme Under Grant Agreement No.\n945539 (Human Brain Project SGA3).
