                <td>AI will affect almost 40 percent of jobs around the world, replacing some and complementing others. We need a careful balance of policies to tap its potential In a new analysis, IMF staff examine the potential impact of AI on the global labor market. Many studies have predicted the likelihood that jobs will be replaced by AI. Yet we know that in many cases AI is likely to complement human work. Historically, automation and information technology have tended to affect routine tasks, but one of the things that sets AI apart is its ability to impact high-skilled jobs. As a result, advanced economies face greater risks from AI—but also more opportunities to leverage its benefits—compared with emerging market and developing economies. In advanced economies, about 60 percent of jobs may be impacted by AI. Roughly half the exposed jobs may benefit from AI integration, enhancing productivity. For the other half, AI applications may execute key tasks currently performed by humans, which could lower labor demand, leading to lower wages and reduced hiring. In the most extreme cases, some of these jobs may disappear. In emerging markets and low-income countries, by contrast, AI exposure is expected to be 40 percent and 26 percent, respectively. We are on the brink of a technological revolution that could jumpstart productivity, boost global growth and raise incomes around the world. Yet it could also replace jobs and deepen inequality. The rapid advance of artificial intelligence has captivated the world, causing both excitement and alarm, and raising important questions about its potential impact on the global economy.</td>

                <td>The use of artificial intelligence for day-to-day tasks has increased rapidly over the last decade. The May 2023 CfM-CEPR survey asked the members of its European panel to predict the impact of AI on global economic growth and unemployment rates in high-income countries over the upcoming decade. The World Economic Forum concluded in October 2020 that while AI would likely take away 85 million jobs globally by 2025, it would also generate 97 million new jobs in fields ranging from big data and machine learning to information security and digital marketing. Lawrence et al. (2017) argue that AI automation is unlikely to negatively impact the employment market due to its large positive spillover effects (reinstatement effect), which would counteract the negative direct effects of substitution in the labour market and can be seen as a Schumpeterian ‘creative destruction’. They believe that automation is likely to transform, rather than eliminate, work. Andrea Ferrero (University of Oxford) highlights this uncertainty: “I expect unemployment to increase in the short run as human employment in some tasks and jobs becomes obsolete. In the medium run, the supply will adjust and it's possible that AI may even reduce the natural rate of unemployment in the long run. I'm just not sure.” · A fraction of the panel expresses pessimism regarding the impact of AI on the labour market due to its impact on vulnerable groups. Some opinion pieces project that AI and robotics will have created up to 90 million jobs by 2025, indicating a strong positive labour market impact. Bowles (2014) uses Frey and Osborne’s (2013) framework to estimate that 54% of EU jobs are at risk of computerisation. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) provide a historical example of excessive automation negatively affecting the labour market due to weak productivity and reinstatement effects, finding that areas in the US most exposed to industrial automation in the 1990s and 2000s experienced large and robust negative effects on employment and wages.</td>
