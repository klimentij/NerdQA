**Evidence:**
- s17247740156397318: This report documents Russian authorities’ stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control.

- s17247740156399230: The Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information.
- s17247740156406059: They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. “The Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,” Gorbunova said. “Today people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.”

#### Statement 2

**Statement:** Since the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government has significantly expanded its legal measures to suppress dissent, severely restricting freedom of speech and assembly.

**Evidence:**
- s17247740156405350: Dissent is not tolerated in Vladimir Putin's Russia. For years Kremlin critics have faced a host of laws which could be used against them, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that toolbox of measures has swelled in size. The laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia's constitution.
- s17247740156409618: In April 2023, prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail on charges of treason and spreading "false information" about the Russian army. His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools.

**Evidence:**
- s17247740156391900: Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online.

- s17247740156406059: They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. “The Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,” Gorbunova said. “Today people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.”

#### Statement 4

**Statement:** The Russian government manipulates legal definitions of extremism to suppress dissent and restrict freedom of speech, creating a hostile environment for critics.

**Evidence:**
- s17247740156407344: The Russian government has the power to make such determinations, he observed, and is using that power to define speech that it does not like as "extremist." He noted that the government is successfully finding experts willing to testify in support of their claims, thereby providing a basis for these cases and in effect helping the government to restrict the freedom of speech and academic inquiry.
- s17247740156406059: They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. “The Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,” Gorbunova said. “Today people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.”

**Support Score:** 0.94

**Explanation:** The evidence indicates that the Russian government has employed vague laws to label criticism as "extremist," which has been used to justify the suppression of free speech.
