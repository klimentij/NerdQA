We shared, cried, laughed, commiserated, and connected about the highs and lows of life on the road. I’ve gotten a ton of questions about remote therapy since sharing so vulnerably, and so I wanted to take the time to explain how it’s help me manage mental health and wellness as a full-time vanlife nomad. It’s no coincidence that I’m suddenly able to write, read, film videos, create content, and confidently negotiate for the treatment I deserve in work, life, and love. Having my therapist by my side even while I’m living nomadically is like living with a 24/7 mental health personal trainer. As a digital nomad who travels full-time, online therapy has been a total game changer in supporting my mental health while living and traveling solo on the road.</td>

But in many families, getting along isn&#x27;t a given. The interaction between various members is at the core of these complicated dynamics. The parent may have underlying personality traits that result in harmful family dynamics. The destructive parent may try to manipulate others; demand support but offer no support; remain inconsistent with rules and operate unfairly. They can also be judgmental, critical, and unaccountable. All of which harms the family unit, maybe for life or even generations. ... Enmeshment is when two or more members become overly involved with and reactive to one another. Relationships that have few boundaries can become enmeshed. As uncomfortable as setting limits may be, they are good for relationships, not bad. ... To set limits, you need to know your thresholds. This starts with healthy self-awareness and what you value, both of which are important when you’re dealing with young family members who are only starting to learn about themselves and their needs. Boundaries also bring out hot-button emotions, and the ability to regulate those emotions is a necessary skill. Can family dynamics be repeated from generation to generation? For mothers abused as children, dysfunctional family dynamics persist in their extended families, making it impossible to maintain relationships and connection. Enmeshment masquerades under the name of unity, family love, filial piety, or loyalty. However, enmeshment comes from fear, not love. A genuinely supportive family is one that empowers a young person to forge their own life path. The child should not be bound to conditional love at the expense of their sense of agency.</td>
