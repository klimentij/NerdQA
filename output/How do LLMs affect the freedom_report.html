Jan. 22, 2008 ... A number of legal restrictions on free speech have been enacted into law in Russia in recent years on the pretext of national security and combating extremism, reported Dmitry Dubrovskiy, executive director, Ethnic Studies Program, European University; chair, Department of Modern Ethnography, Russian Museum of Ethnography, St. Russia has a long tradition of official censorship, Dubrovskiy observed. In the tsarist era, censorship was employed by the state to defend state security in the "public interest." Restriction on free expression continued and expanded during the Soviet era. It was only in the 1980s during perestroika that restrictions on free speech began to be eased. As the country transitioned into the 1990s, freedom of speech was greater than ever before. This period coincided with a rapidly declining economy, in which the vast majority of Russians struggled. Dubrovskiy observed that as a result of this economic collapse, most Russians believe that freedom of speech does not bring tangible benefits, and it is therefore less important than political and economic stability. The Russian government has the power to make such determinations, he observed, and is using that power to define speech that it does not like as "extremist." He noted that the government is successfully finding experts willing to testify in support of their claims, thereby providing a basis for these cases and in effect helping the government to restrict the freedom of speech and academic inquiry.</td>

As of 2023, Russia ranked 164 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Despite the constitution's provision of freedom of speech, the authorities possess significant discretion to suppress any speech, organization, or activity lacking official support due to ambiguous extremism laws. The Russian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; however, government application of law, bureaucratic regulation, and politically motivated criminal investigations have forced the press to exercise self-censorship constraining its coverage of certain controversial issues, resulting in infringements of these rights. Russian Ombudsman Vladimir Lukin reported in 2006 that claims declaring that freedom of speech is non-existent in Russia would be an exaggeration, the constitutional right for speech freedom is basically observed, and there is no institutionalized censorship. Russian head of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs Konstantin Kosachev said in a 2005 interview that there were no differences between freedom of speech in Russia and Western countries in regards to the printed media: "there is an enormous amount of newspapers which write any sort of stuff." While there are provisions in the Russian Constitution that guarantee freedom of speech and specifically forbid censorship, the practical execution of numerous legal acts and dependence of courts results in practically unlimited control of the government over what is published and where.</td>

This report documents Russian authorities’ stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews, and shut down or blocked access to hundreds of websites and web pages. While new restrictions on freedom of expression appear to target political opposition or civic groups, they affect all Russians. Curbing free speech denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or even mildly critical of Russia’s foreign policy. The Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information. Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online. Authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens on criminal charges for social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews. Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term.</td>

Anna Bazhutova was jailed for five and a half years for spreading "fake information" on the Russian army · Dissent is not tolerated in Vladimir Putin's Russia. Russia's "foreign agents" law allows restrictions to be imposed on critics without convicting them of any wrongdoing. Individuals or organisations that have criticised or scrutinised government policies are targeted if they are deemed to have received money from abroad - even from a relative - or merely to be under "foreign influence". All manner of organisations have been banned from Russia in this way – from the NGO Greenpeace to London-based think-tank Chatham House, as well as a number of key Russian media outlets. Late opposition leader Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation was disbanded after being declared “extremist” – another label used to effectively erase individuals and organisations from public life. Russian-language tutor Raisa Boldova, 61, was handed a suspended one-year community service sentence for posting critical comments about attacks on civilians in Ukraine, including the bombing of the Mariupol maternity hospital.</td>

                <td>Since 2013, 3,738 people have been convicted of terrorism-related crimes. Notably, more than 90% of these convictions did not arise in relation to terrorist attacks, committed or planned. The expansion of Russia’s anti-terrorism and anti-extremism laws, including the 2006 criminalization of “justification of terrorism” and the 2023 proposal to criminalize the “justification of extremism” further blurs the lines between terrorism and extremism – neither of which are well defined in international law, and both of which are frequently weaponized to stifle dissent. “These steps demonstrate a systematic approach to broaden definitions and penalties, stifling political opposition and freedom of expression under the guise of ‘national security’,” said Oleg Kozlovsk Qualification as ‘terrorism’ of at least some of these acts, where they did not pose a threat of serious injury, raises concerns that Russian authorities are abusing these charges. Hundreds of individuals were convicted under “justification of terrorism” charges for merely discussing or expressing sympathy towards specific actions or entities arbitrarily designated as “terrorist” by the Russian authorities. A disturbing escalation in the abuse of vague anti-terrorism and anti-extremism legislation in Russia has intensified since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Amnesty International said today. The briefing “Terrorising the dissent” documents how Russia’s authorities have increasingly targeted dissenters and peaceful protesters under the guise of “national security.” The Ministry of Justice only reported that the writer “actively spoke out against the special military operation in Ukraine, disseminated false information aimed at creating a negative image of the Russian Federation, as well as the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.” · These and numerous other cases demonstrate the broad application of these laws against any form of dissent.</td>

This study, using content analysis and frame analysis, examines whether there is any connection between the International Criminal Court’s (ICC’s) announcement on the fifth day of Russia’s war against Ukraine (which began on 24 February 2022) that it would investigate credible allegations of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine, and the reporting of the international press in those first five days. Since this study is about media discourse and public opinion, this article first discusses the theory of the public sphere, how the public sphere is constructed, and how persuasive communication is formed through discourse information processing under the theoretical light of “Discourse Information Theory”. Following this, it highlights how the media contributes to the creation of the public sphere through “news construction” and the factors that influence this news construction, such as the nature of news value theory, the relationship of journalism to power, and dependence on news sources, language, and propaganda (Galtung and Ruge 1965; Herman and Chomsky 1988). Knowing what impact these factors have had on news reporting on evidence for Russian war crimes in Ukraine will help us understand what agenda they set through their reporting. In Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media, Herman and Chomsky (1988) explain how elites use media propaganda to influence mass public opinion in their favour. They describe the influence of institutional realities, administrative practices, and ideologies on journalism practices through the propaganda model. This model can explain propaganda as a systematic procedure that shapes people’s minds—influencing sentiments, feelings, and behaviours—to support propagandists’ goals. It is also possible for the language of coverage, which often mimics the language of official news sources, to be affected by this dependence. Against this backdrop, it is important to examine how influencing factors of news production, such as news value theory; the relationship of journalism to power; and dependence on news sources, language, and propaganda (Galtung and Ruge 1965; Herman and Chomsky 1988), can influence the media’s role in justifying ICC intervention. This study asks whether there is any functional relationship between media reporting and invoking the ICC’s jurisdiction. Therefore, it aims to address this scholarly deficit using reporting on allegations of Russia’s war crimes in Ukraine as a case in point.</td>

Amid the above, the relevant narrative the OMI team needs to further focus on should include the interplay between the war and the personal welfare of Russian society, particularly the potential direct impact the war can make on ordinary Russians in short- and long-term, also showing the lack of prospects for Russia and its citizens if they decide to continue the “special military operation”. According to Russian Field, almost half of the respondents (48%) admitted that the events around Ukraine had a negative impact on their mental well-being. However, if one reframes questions slightly, then it also becomes clear that Russians would not oppose peace talks (if any), suggesting that their opinion goes where the Russian leadership instructs it to go and that more and more Russians are concerned about the end of the war. Following the relevant announcement, there has also been a great increase in dissatisfaction with the government among Russians in their social media discussions. ... Another trend is that half of the respondents do not believe in the fairness of mobilization process on a regional basis. There is also a negative opinion regarding the way the mobilized troops are supplied, especially among young people.</td>
