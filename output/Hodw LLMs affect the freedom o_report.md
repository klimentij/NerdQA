#### Statement 1 (ID: S1584635846)

**Statement:** The Russian government has intensified its control over online speech, prosecuting individuals for social media posts and implementing laws that restrict freedom of expression, which affects all citizens.

**Evidence:**
- E4752283593: This report documents Russian authorities’ stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, ... This report documents Russian authorities’ stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews, and shut down or blocked access to hundreds of websites and web pages. While new restrictions on freedom of expression appear to target political opposition or civic groups, they affect all Russians. Curbing free speech denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or even mildly critical of Russia’s foreign policy. The Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information. Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online. Authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens on criminal charges for social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews. Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term.

#### Statement 2 (ID: S9192001214)

**Statement:** Following the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government has enacted laws that severely restrict freedom of speech and assembly, effectively criminalizing dissent.

**Evidence:**
- E7157692312: Since the invasion of Ukraine, the measures used to clamp down on Kremlin critics have swelled. Dissent is not tolerated in Vladimir Putin's Russia. For years Kremlin critics have faced a host of laws which could be used against them, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that toolbox of measures has swelled in size. The laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia's constitution. In April 2023, prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail on charges of treason and spreading "false information" about the Russian army. His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools. Among Russia's "foreign agents" are election monitor Golos, prominent pollster Levada Centre, rights group OVD-Info, a movement of wives of mobilised soldiers called The Way Home and numerous independent news websites and journalists including Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov. According to prominent Russian human rights group OVD-Info, more than 300 people have since been charged or convicted under it.

His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools.

**Support Score:** 0.92

**Explanation:** The evidence shows that since the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government has expanded its legal framework to suppress dissent, with laws targeting freedom of speech and assembly. The article states, "Dissent is not tolerated in Vladimir Putin's Russia... the laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia's constitution."

#### Statement 3 (ID: S8810396366)

**Statement:** The Russian government's legislative actions since the invasion of Ukraine represent a significant escalation in the suppression of civic freedoms and freedom of expression.

**Evidence:**
- E4814339230: The Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information.

- E5187359904: The Russian government’s dismantling of civic freedoms since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is a dramatic escalation of its sustained assault on fundamental rights spanning more than a decade. (New York, August 7, 2024) – The Russian government’s dismantling of civic freedoms since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is a dramatic escalation of its sustained assault on fundamental rights spanning more than a decade, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 205-page report, “Russia’s Legislative Minefield: Tripwires for Civil Society since 2020,” focuses on the wave of repressive legislation and policies that the Russian government of President Vladimir Putin has adopted since 2020 and how the Kremlin has used them to suppress internal dissent and incapacitate civil society. These laws severely restrict the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, and impose state-enforced historical, social, and political narratives in public life. A series of amendments shredded what had remained of freedom of peaceful assembly, effectively making legitimate protest illegal, Human Rights Watch said. The authorities introduced a stringent licensing system that requires protest organizers to request and receive explicit authorization for a public assembly. They equated public strolls and a series of single-person pickets with mass protests, closing the few loopholes that people had used to hold protests and avoid Russia’s repressive public assembly provisions. “Yet independent groups and media are persisting, and they provide hope for the eventual transformation of Russia into a country committed to protecting and promoting fundamental rights.” · Human Rights Watch examined this repressive legislation in eight broad areas: “foreign agents,” public assembly, electoral rights, freedom of expression, sexual orientation and gender identity, treason and similar concepts, historical truth, and education.

**Support Score:** 0.93

**Explanation:** The evidence indicates that the Russian government's crackdown on civic freedoms has escalated since the invasion of Ukraine, with new laws introduced to suppress dissent and control public discourse. The report states, "The Russian government’s dismantling of civic freedoms since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine... is a dramatic escalation of its sustained assault on fundamental rights spanning more than a decade."

#### Statement 4 (ID: S7584471425)

**Statement:** The Russian government employs vague legal definitions to suppress dissent, creating an environment of fear that stifles freedom of speech and expression.

**Evidence:**
- E4814339230: The Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information.
- E9960261900: Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online. Authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens on criminal charges for social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews. Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term.
- E4005010095: Instead of overt brutality, the latest campaign is being waged quietly with a vague legal tool: a law regulating the activities of so-called foreign agents. MOSCOW — Russia is in the midst of the largest crackdown on the free press and political dissent since the Soviet era. And the list is public, often serving as the initial notification affected parties get from authorities informing them of their new reality. The Norwegian Nobel Committee recognized the challenges Russian journalists face on Oct. 8, when Dmitry Muratov — an editor at the independent news outlet Novaya Gazeta — was jointly awarded this year’s peace prize for his “efforts to safeguard freedom of expression” in Russia. The Kremlin's moves against domestic dissent have sparked fears of a return to the communist era's approach to free speech.Spencer Platt / Getty Images · The foreign agent law was signed in 2012. Before its first use against the media in 2017, it was used against nongovernmental organizations and civil society groups — often those that focus on human rights — that had received foreign grant money. “I don’t think there has ever been a worse time for Russian civic society and media in general,” said Alexey Kovalev, an editor at the independent news site Meduza. It was first used against a media outlet in 2017, when several U.S.-government funded outlets, such as the Voice of America, were declared foreign agents. But, last year, the state began to deploy it against independent Russian journalists.

**Support Score:** 0.94

**Explanation:** The evidence shows that the Russian government has utilized vague legal definitions to suppress dissent, particularly through the 'foreign agents' law and laws against 'extremism.' The report states, "The Kremlin's moves against domestic dissent have sparked fears of a return to the communist era's approach to free speech," indicating a systematic effort to control narratives.

How are LLMs used in Russian social media to influence public opinion?

### Generated Statements

#### Statement 1 (ID: S5887052550)

**Statement:** Russian social media platforms are utilized to spread disinformation and manipulate public opinion, particularly during significant political events like the invasion of Ukraine, contributing to the suppression of dissent.

**Evidence:**
- E4155986413: The Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 was accompanied by practices of information warfare, yet existing evidence is largely anecdotal while large-scale empirical evidence is lacking. Here, we analyze the spread of pro-Russian support on social media. This gives rise to growing concerns that social media may be strategically used to increase political division and influence public opinion as a tool of modern warfare [15–18]. For example, a coordinated social media campaign was launched by a Russian organization known as the Internet Research Agency (IRA) during the 2014 Russo-Ukrainian conflict [16, 19]. The IRA has also been suspected of meddling in several elections. Strikingly, many bots that spread pro-Russian messages were created shortly before the UN vote, which indicates an intentional and planned manipulation of public opinion on Twitter as part of a Russian propaganda campaign. Our findings demonstrate that bots are an important driver in the early diffusion of bot-created propaganda on social media. Bots were more active retweeters than humans and acted together in a coordinated manner. Unlike spreaders of low-credibility content [20] and inflammatory content [34], bots mentioned users with less social influence than humans when spreading pro-Russian messages. Third, propaganda on social media may influence public opinion and increase political division. It is thus important that policy-makers are aware of the potential threats that social media propaganda poses to modern societies. As such, it will be critical to continuously monitor and actively counter the proliferation of online propaganda in the future. The data and code that support the findings of our study are available on GitHub (https://github.com/DominiqueGeissler/Russian_Propaganda_on_social_media). Fifth, the accuracy of our analysis depends on the accuracy of other tools such as Botometer [48]. However, these tools have been shown to achieve a high accuracy [48] and are widely used in research [20, 24, 29, 70]. Sixth, while the scale of the pro-Russian support on Twitter is impressive in absolute terms (e.g., reached ∼14.4 million users), it may not have infiltrated online communities to an extent that swayed public opinion.

- S1584635846: [Previous statement S1584635846]: The Russian government has intensified its control over online speech, prosecuting individuals for social media posts and implementing laws that restrict freedom of expression, which affects all citizens.
- S9192001214: [Previous statement S9192001214]: Following the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian government has enacted laws that severely restrict freedom of speech and assembly, effectively criminalizing dissent.

**Support Score:** 0.95

**Explanation:** The evidence indicates that Russian social media platforms have been used to spread disinformation and manipulate public opinion, particularly during the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The study highlights that social media campaigns, including those by the Internet Research Agency, have been strategically employed to increase political division and influence public sentiment. This aligns with previous statements about the Russian government's efforts to suppress dissent and control online speech, suggesting that social media is a critical tool in this broader strategy.

#### Statement 2 (ID: S2274247340)

**Statement:** The Russian government systematically uses social media to influence public opinion and suppress dissent, particularly against neighboring governments and NATO.

**Evidence:**
- E2795121603: Russia uses social media in nearby states to sow dissent against neighboring governments and NATO. Options for countering the Kremlin&#x27;s campaign include tracking and blocking propaganda more quickly and offering alternative content to help displace the Russian narrative. Researchers analyzed Russian social media data and conducted interviews with regional and security experts to understand the critical ingredients to countering Russia's propaganda campaign against former Soviet states. Consider launching a public information campaign that can more immediately teach media literacy to a mass audience. Expand and improve local and original content to displace the Russian media narrative. Empower social media and other activists in the region by identifying key influencers and offering a series of programming geared to enhance their influence potential. Identify fake-news stories and their sources, understand Russian narrative themes and content, and understand the broader Russian strategy that underlies tactical propaganda messaging. In addition, use resonance analysis to track the impact and spread of RP and influence. RAND is a nonprofit institution that helps improve policy and decisionmaking through research and analysis.
