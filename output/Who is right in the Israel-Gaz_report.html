Historian Jean-Pierre Filiu finds this assertion "absurd", given that up to this point Israel had already fought 9 wars against Gaza. The declaration allowed Israel to prevent the transfer of electricity, fuel, and other supplies into Gaza. The Gaza–Israel conflict is a localized part of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict beginning in 1948, when 200,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes, settling in the Gaza Strip as refugees. Since then, Israel has been involved in about 15 wars against the Gaza Strip. Israel fought three wars in the Egyptian-administered Gaza Strip: 1948 Palestine War, the first occupation of Gaza during the Suez Crisis, and the capture of Gaza in 1967. During the first occupation, 1% of Gaza Strip's population was either killed, tortured or imprisoned by Israel. Following two periods of low-level insurgencies, a major conflict between Israelis and Palestinians erupted in the First Intifada. The 1993 Oslo Accords brought a period of calm.

The future of the West Bank and East Jerusalem is one of the most difficult issues of the Israel-Palestinian conflict. An internationally backed plan for peace is known as the "two-state solution". Israel's most important ally, the US, sees a two-state solution as the way forward once the Gaza war ends. A two-state solution is also formally supported by the PA. However, since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are regarded as illegal by most of the rest of the world, though Israel disputes this. The PA insists all settlements must be removed as part of any future peace deal. The UN and aid agencies say Gaza is suffering severe shortages of food and other essentials including fuel and medicine. This is particularly acute in northern Gaza, where it is especially difficult to deliver aid which enters the territory from the south. A UN-backed report says the situation across Gaza is turning into a man-made famine.

Finally, in response to arguments that Israel’s power over Gaza’s borders is evidence of effective control, they hold that while Israel retains control over the Israeli-Gaza border, Egypt controls Gaza’s border with Sinai. Based on these considerations, some experts have found that “siege” better describes the situation.

Tell Congress: Call for a cease-fire and humanitarian access in Gaza now!: Urge them to insist that Israel adhere to international humanitarian and human rights law and call for a permanent cease-fire to end Israel's bombing of Gaza.

It conducts public opinion polling, demographic research, media content analysis and other empirical social science research.

The report comes from researchers at the University Network for Human Rights, a consortium of human right centers 4. Is it reasonable to ask Israel to support any solution that does not include the unequivocal right to exist and their borders be recognized? %. What responsibility to Israel have to creating the current conditions in Gaza since the Nakba? These are fundamental aspects to this conflict that require more consideration. Akram: Between October 7, 2023, and May 1, 2024—the period covered in our report—Israel has killed at least 34,000 Palestinians and injured over 78,000 in Gaza, comprising over 5 percent of Gaza’s population. Of those killed, [around] 14,000 are children—more children in the first four months of Israel’s assault than have been killed in all the world’s conflicts in the last four years. Now, an “objective, methodological, and detailed analysis” conducted in part by the Boston University School of Law’s International Human Rights Clinic as part of a report from the University Network for Human Rights (UNHR), a consortium of human rights centers at colleges across the world, has released its finding. The UNHR report, released in mid-May, concludes: “Israel has committed genocidal acts, namely killing, seriously harming, and inflicting conditions of life calculated, and intended to, bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza,” says Susan Akram, a LAW clinical professor of law and director of LAW’s International Human Rights Clinic, who contributed to the report.<br><a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/is-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/" target="_blank">https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/is-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/</a></li><li id="tree-E4718111533"><strong>E4718111533:</strong> For decades, Israel has systematically violated its obligations under international law toward Palestinians, violating their rights and implementing a system of apartheid in the areas it controls.

The number of Gazans reportedly killed in the ongoing 2023–2024 war (37,000) is higher than the death toll of all other wars of the Arab–Israeli conflict. On 3 May, two Israeli soldiers were injured by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper from in the Gaza Strip during the weekly protests at the Gaza–Israel border. In response, the Israeli Air Force carried out an airstrike, killing four Palestinians. In addition, two other Palestinians were killed and 60 wounded, 36 of them by Israeli gunfire. Following this, Gazan militants launched hundreds of rockets at Israel. In 2014, Israel invaded Gaza in a major war that resulted in the deaths of 73 Israelis (mostly soldiers) and 2,251 Palestinians (mostly civilians). The invasion resulted in "unprecedented" destruction, damaging 25% of homes in Gaza city and 70% of homes in Beit Hanoun.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza–Israel_conflict" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza–Israel_conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E2612576340"><strong>E2612576340:</strong> More than 33,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed in air and artillery strikes carried out by the Israeli military in response, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says.<br><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44124396" target="_blank">https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44124396</a></li><li id="tree-S9402201343"><strong>S9402201343:</strong> Israeli military operations in Gaza have resulted in high civilian casualties, raising concerns about compliance with international humanitarian law.<ul><li id="tree-E1903735679"><strong>E1903735679:</strong> Ministers were eager to emphasise that the suspension did not represent a step away from the UK’s commitment to Israel’s security and pointed out that such suspensions had occurred in previous Israeli conflicts.<br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/02/israel-gaza-war-live-israel-faces-nationwide-general-strike-amid-public-anger-over-hostage-deaths-and-failed-ceasefire-talks" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2024/sep/02/israel-gaza-war-live-israel-faces-nationwide-general-strike-amid-public-anger-over-hostage-deaths-and-failed-ceasefire-talks</a></li><li id="tree-E2914084672"><strong>E2914084672:</strong> After Israel’s previous attacks on Gaza, there were promises that the blockade would be lessened or ended.

He also called for the necessary practical measures to address the root causes of the issue and end the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory with Jerusalem as the capital of the Palestinian State as per the Council’s resolutions and as per the peace process and international law, and also empowering the Palestinians to enjoy their inalienable rights, including the return of refugees and self-determination, as per General Assembly resolution 194 (III). As Iran’s proxy, Hamas had three objectives for its barbaric attack: the murder of Jews, the kidnapping of hostages and the derailment of peace, stability and normalization in the region, he said, adding that Israeli citizens are under heavy missile and rocket fire from Gaza. Meanwhile, there is a clear attempt to escalate and provoke a war on Israel’s northern border where the Iran proxy Hezbollah is targeting Israeli cities, he said. Last week, cruise missiles were launched at Israel from Yemen. Have no illusion who is behind it or what is the reason, he said. The international community must understand who is under threat and who is the aggressor, he added.<br><a href="https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15462.doc.htm" target="_blank">https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15462.doc.htm</a></li><li id="tree-S8586398668"><strong>S8586398668:</strong> International organizations, particularly the United Nations, are responding to the escalating conflict in Israel and Gaza and are working to prevent further violence and humanitarian crises.<ul><li id="tree-E4034700396"><strong>E4034700396:</strong> Human rights groups and aid organisations have accused Hamas and Israel of war crimes.

Human rights groups and aid organisations have accused Hamas and Israel of war crimes. An estimated 1,166–1,417 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died in the conflict. The conflict came to an end on 18 January after first Israel and then Hamas announced unilateral ceasefires. On 21 January, Israel completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. On 2 March, it was reported that international donors had pledged $4.5 billion in aid for the Palestinians, mainly for rebuilding Gaza after Israel's offensive. Some 300 Palestinians had been targeted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip since the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit. In July 2006, first reports emerged about mystery injuries after Israeli attacks. Previously unseen injuries included severely damaged internal organs, severe internal burning and deep internal wounds often resulting in amputations or death. Israel's decision to cut fuel supplies to Gaza were widely condemned (including by the European Union) as "collective punishment." Israel has also arrested Hamas officials in the West Bank, including two cabinet members. Such arrests have been strongly condemned by international organizations and politicians. The international condemnation of Israeli incursion was further augmented with a scathing report prepared by eight British-based rights organizations, highlighting humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip that reached its worst point since Israel captured the territory in 1967. In response to the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, to the interdiction of the activity of the Moslem Brothers in Egypt and to what he interpreted as Egyptian support for Israel, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi an "illegitimate tyrant". He also stated that "If Israel continues with this attitude, it will definitely be tried at international courts."<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza–Israel_conflict" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza–Israel_conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E5671529528"><strong>E5671529528:</strong> The United Nations and its partners issued a plan that outlines the minimum necessary to scale up humanitarian operations in support of 2.2 million people in the Gaza Strip and 500,000 of the most vulnerable in the West Bank.

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) submitted a complaint on 31 October to the ICC for “war crimes committed against journalists in Israel and Palestine,” citing the death of nine journalists, an Israeli killed during the attack on his kibbutz on 7 October, and eight Palestinians. The document mentions the destruction of 50 premises belonging to press organizations in Gaza. In the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, international justice is being summoned, with several complaints lodged at the International Criminal Court (ICC) following the 7 October attack by Hamas in Israel and the response by Israeli Defense Forces in Gaza. During his visit to the Rafah crossing point on 29 October, located between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, Karim Kahn stated in his declaration that “hostage-taking is a serious violation of the Geneva Conventions,” and called for the release of the 239 individuals held by Hamas. He also reminded Israel of its “obligation to comply with the laws of armed conflict,” stating that “impeding relief supplies may constitute a crime“. Referring to the presence of military advocate generals within the Israeli army, he declared: “They will need to demonstrate that any attack, any attack that impacts innocent civilians or protected objects, must be conducted in accordance with the laws and customs of war, in accordance with the laws of armed conflict. It ruled in 2021 that its “territorial jurisdiction extends to the territories occupied by Israel since 1967, namely Gaza, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem.” · The International Court of Justice (ICJ), competent to deal with disputes between states, released a statement on 23 October regarding a request for an advisory opinion submitted on 30 December 2022 by a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly prior to the outbreak of the current conflict.<br><a href="https://unric.org/en/israel-palestine-the-role-of-international-justice/" target="_blank">https://unric.org/en/israel-palestine-the-role-of-international-justice/</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S8430434566" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S1985880169"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S1985880169</h3><ul><li id="tree-S1985880169"><strong>S1985880169:</strong> The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) represents a significant grassroots effort aimed at fostering cooperation and peace between Israelis and Palestinians.<ul><li id="tree-E3673069937"><strong>E3673069937:</strong> ALLMEP is proud to announce a new season of Groundwork Learn More Season 3 is out now!

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

Ambassador Cheikh Niang,Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,It is my honour to open the 2024 Conference of Civil Society Organisations working on the Question of Palestine – titled “Building Bridges with International Civil Society to Address the Ongoing Nakba” – and organised by the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.This event takes place in a harrowing context of unprecedented devastation. As flagged by our Office in mid-December already, "Gaza has seemingly become the deadliest place for journalists – in the world." Tragically, killings of journalists have continued. The Committee to Protect Journalists’ preliminary investigations indicate that at least 95 journalists and media workers have been killed (90 Palestinians, 2 Israelis and 3 Lebanese). Also smear campaigns against artists, peace activists and human rights defenders, in and outside of Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory have intensified, including the targeting of mandated independent experts of the human rights mechanisms, portraying free speech as incitement to violence, terrorism or antisemitism, while incitement to violence and hatred continues against Palestinians with impunity. While Gaza is destroyed, tensions in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, remain high. The drastic acceleration in Israeli settlements and record high settler and State violence including extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, are worsening long-standing patterns of violence, oppression, discrimination and debilitating movement restrictions, leading to the forcible displacement of Palestinian communities, amid a continuing dire fiscal crisis facing the Palestinian Authority. Today, with the total number of people killed in Gaza exceeding 32,000, we witness Palestinians also dying from malnutrition and dehydration. This human-made catastrophe was entirely preventable. Our Office has called on all States with influence to do everything within their power to avert a full-scale assault in Rafah, which would take the nightmare into a new cataclysmic dimension. Israel, as the occupying power, is obligated under international humanitarian law to provide, or protect and facilitate the safe distribution of humanitarian aid to the civilian population.<br><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2024/04/civil-society-and-civilians-must-be-protected-harrowing-gaza" target="_blank">https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2024/04/civil-society-and-civilians-must-be-protected-harrowing-gaza</a></li><li id="tree-E4550139444"><strong>E4550139444:</strong> Ambassador Cheikh Niang,Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,It is my honour to open the 2024 Conference of Civil Society Organisations working on the Question of Palestine – titled “Building Bridges with International Civil Society to Address the Ongoing Nakba” – and organised by the ...<br><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2024/04/civil-society-and-civilians-must-be-protected-harrowing-gaza" target="_blank">https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2024/04/civil-society-and-civilians-must-be-protected-harrowing-gaza</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S9697446645" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S1752459528"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S1752459528</h3><ul><li id="tree-S1752459528"><strong>S1752459528:</strong> Civil society movements like Standing Together emphasize the importance of solidarity and empathy in their advocacy for peace, aiming to influence public sentiment in the Israel-Gaza situation.<ul><li id="tree-E3319167708"><strong>E3319167708:</strong> As the death toll mounts in Gaza, there remains little patience in Israel for the peace movement following the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7. There is little patience for the peace movement in Israel following Hamas' unprecedented attack on Oct. 7. Green says that his organization, and many other peace groups in Israel, have not protested the war in Gaza because it is too dangerous. “If you go out in the street and have a sign or a slogan against the war, you can die,” he says. The war against Hamas is backed by nearly all corners of Israeli society. Goren says that Israel’s blockade of Gaza and ongoing airstrikes are putting many Gazan citizens in a desperate situation, not to mention a death toll that has surpassed 5,000. Goren says that Palestinians put in desperate situations are more likely to support groups like Hamas. “Being a peace activist in Israel is labeled these days as being a traitor, someone who cheers for the other team. People think you hate your own people, you are an auto-antisemite,” says Udi Goren, an Israeli photographer who opposes the war in Gaza.

Israel responded by bombing the Gaza Strip and launching an invasion that has killed more than 34,000 Gazans as of April 2024. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. During the second week of March 2012, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) initiated Operation "Returning Echo". It was the worst outbreak of violence covered by the media in the region since the 2008–09 Operation "Cast Lead" (the Gaza War). Attacks by Israel and Gazans grew intense late in October 2012. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon stated he believed that the Qassam rocket attacks by factions in Gaza were "completely unacceptable." He also said he believed that the Palestinian Authority should "take the necessary steps to restore law and order, and for all factions to abide by the ceasefire." Ban also stated he was "deeply concerned by the mounting number of civilian casualties from Israeli military operations in Gaza." The Gaza–Israel conflict is a localized part of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict beginning in 1948, when 200,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled from their homes, settling in the Gaza Strip as refugees. Since then, Israel has been involved in about 15 wars against the Gaza Strip. The number of Gazans reportedly killed in the ongoing 2023–2024 war (37,000) is higher than the death toll of all other wars of the Arab–Israeli conflict. On 3 May, two Israeli soldiers were injured by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper from in the Gaza Strip during the weekly protests at the Gaza–Israel border. In response, the Israeli Air Force carried out an airstrike, killing four Palestinians. In addition, two other Palestinians were killed and 60 wounded, 36 of them by Israeli gunfire.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

Trump administration prepares to launch its Middle East peace plan, Just Vision’s Suhad Babaa and USIP’s Maria J. Stephan reflect on the potential of grassroots movements to shift the political dynamics that have stalled previous peace efforts. Today we’re exploring the underestimated potential of grassroots movements to shift the political dynamics that have stalled peace efforts around the world. It’s an opportunity we can ill afford to ignore for our hopes for success from the current peace talks in Afghanistan and Yemen to the search for ways to break the impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Now, to explore these issues, we are lucky to be joined today by Suhad Babaa, the executive director of Just Vision, an organization dedicated to increasing the power and reach of Palestinian and Israeli grassroots leaders. She’s also the executive producer of the acclaimed feature-length documentary Naila and the Uprising, which we’ll see a clip of today. We’re also lucky to be joined by Maria Stephan, director of the Program on Nonviolent Action at the U.S. Institute of Peace and an expert on the role of nonviolent movements in transforming violent conflict and advancing just peace. And so I think just this idea of you need sometimes the pressure, the escalation, to get to the point where you can have the kind of meaningful dialogues to get to resolution is where the civil resistance and peace building come together. BIGIO: So let’s come back to today.

Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples. Neither approach can work by itself, Mitchell said in a recent discussion that explored whether a type of fund used to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland’s peace process could be applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all.

As the war in Israel and Gaza rages, the level of civilian deaths and destruction is likely to keep the story prominent in the U.S. The Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, and the ensuing Israeli attacks in Gaza have captured global attention. How has the war affected American public attitudes toward the Israeli-Palestinian issue broadly? To probe the issue, the University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll with Ipsos asked several questions focused on the role of the United States and the perception of the Biden administration. The ensuing Israeli attacks initially received only muted official criticism but led to more criticism from some segments of American society, including public demonstrations. As the war in Gaza expanded, more criticisms of Israeli action emerged, particularly in the past week, after the poll was completed. While the initial focus was almost entirely on the toll inflicted by Hamas on Israeli civilians, which generated sympathy across the United States, the Israeli bombings of Gaza and the civilian toll among Palestinians have begun to shift attitudes among key constituencies.<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-the-israel-gaza-war-changing-us-public-attitudes/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-the-israel-gaza-war-changing-us-public-attitudes/</a></li><li id="tree-E4637790252"><strong>E4637790252:</strong> While the initial focus was almost entirely on the toll inflicted by Hamas on Israeli civilians, which generated sympathy across the United States, the Israeli bombings of Gaza and the civilian toll among Palestinians have begun to shift attitudes among key constituencies.<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-the-israel-gaza-war-changing-us-public-attitudes/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/is-the-israel-gaza-war-changing-us-public-attitudes/</a></li><li id="tree-E5664950773"><strong>E5664950773:</strong> Ambassador Cheikh Niang,Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,It is my honour to open the 2024 Conference of Civil Society Organisations working on the Question of Palestine – titled “Building Bridges with International Civil Society to Address the Ongoing Nakba” – and organised by the ... Ambassador Cheikh Niang,Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen,It is my honour to open the 2024 Conference of Civil Society Organisations working on the Question of Palestine – titled “Building Bridges with International Civil Society to Address the Ongoing Nakba” – and organised by the United Nations Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.This event takes place in a harrowing context of unprecedented devastation. While Gaza is destroyed, tensions in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, remain high. The drastic acceleration in Israeli settlements and record high settler and State violence including extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, are worsening long-standing patterns of violence, oppression, discrimination and debilitating movement restrictions, leading to the forcible displacement of Palestinian communities, amid a continuing dire fiscal crisis facing the Palestinian Authority. As a result of attacks on hospitals and medical personnel and the sustained interference with humanitarian assistance, Palestinians in Gaza are dying of disease and hunger, if they are not killed by bombs. Almost half a year has passed since the violent attacks of 7 and 8 October by Al-Qassam and other Palestinian armed groups, including horrific attacks on civilians, which resulted in the killing of nearly 1,200 Israeli and foreign citizens, injuries to over 5,000 others, with reports of torture and sexual violence, and the abduction of over 230 hostages into Gaza, of which around 130 hostages remain captive to date. The Israeli military response in Gaza has been brutal, and there is growing evidence of the systematic violation of international humanitarian law, including the commission of war crimes and possibly other atrocity crimes.<br><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2024/04/civil-society-and-civilians-must-be-protected-harrowing-gaza" target="_blank">https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2024/04/civil-society-and-civilians-must-be-protected-harrowing-gaza</a></li><li id="tree-E7313213959"><strong>E7313213959:</strong> 33% of adults under 30 say their sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people, while 14% say their sympathies lie with the Israeli people. When it comes to humanitarian aid to Gaza, Americans under 30 are somewhat less likely than those 65 and older to favor it. For more information on how we conducted this survey, refer to the ATP’s Methodology and the Methodology for this analysis. Here are the questions on views and knowledge of the Israel-Hamas war used in this analysis, and on perceptions of discrimination since the war began. Americans’ views about the Israel-Hamas war differ widely by age, as do their perceptions about discrimination against Jewish, Muslim and Arab people in the United States. Attitudes about discrimination have also changed over time. Today, 31% of adults under 30 say Jews are facing a lot of discrimination in American society – up from 20% who said the same in 2021.<br><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/younger-americans-stand-out-in-their-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/" target="_blank">https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/younger-americans-stand-out-in-their-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/</a></li><li id="tree-E5191985720"><strong>E5191985720:</strong> 33% of adults under 30 say their sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people, while 14% say their sympathies lie with the Israeli people.<br><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/younger-americans-stand-out-in-their-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/" target="_blank">https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/04/02/younger-americans-stand-out-in-their-views-of-the-israel-hamas-war/</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S9621526684" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S5295408317"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S5295408317</h3><ul><li id="tree-S5295408317"><strong>S5295408317:</strong> Media coverage of the Israel-Gaza conflict is impacting public perception by increasingly highlighting Palestinian civilian casualties, which has led to stronger calls for humanitarian aid and a ceasefire.<ul><li id="tree-E4440357036"><strong>E4440357036:</strong> SIS professor and journalist Elise Labott discusses how media coverage of conflict can impact how the public perceives war. More than 750 journalists from various news organizations, including Reuters, the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, and The Washington Post, signed an open letter condemning Israel’s killing of reporters in Gaza and criticizing the war coverage in Western media. The signatories argue for the use of precise terms like "apartheid" and "ethnic cleansing" to describe Israel’s treatment of Palestinians, pointing out the double standards in reporting. International media outlets tend to provide a more diverse range of perspectives, often highlighting the humanitarian impacts on Palestinian civilians. Just as the coverage of the attack on October 7 evoked intense empathy for Israelis, the current emphasis on Palestinian civilian casualties and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza is evoking strong emotional responses from the public, including calls for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid. Hamas’ horrific October 7 attack on Israel made headlines for several days, and the media still covers personal stories about individual hostages. However, the attack and Hamas’s nature as a terrorist group have been eclipsed by coverage of Palestinian causalities suffered in Gaza, as they are more current, far greater in numbers, and are captured in daily videos on television. American coverage of the military campaign tends to lean towards the Israeli and American governments’ narratives, sometimes at the expense of adequately representing Palestinian viewpoints. The number of Palestinian causalities is often reported with a caveat that numbers come from the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, as if to cast doubt on their legitimacy.<br><a href="https://www.american.edu/sis/news/20231121-how-does-the-media-impact-public-perception-about-war.cfm" target="_blank">https://www.american.edu/sis/news/20231121-how-does-the-media-impact-public-perception-about-war.cfm</a></li><li id="tree-E0811179959"><strong>E0811179959:</strong> Just as the coverage of the attack on October 7 evoked intense empathy for Israelis, the current emphasis on Palestinian civilian casualties and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza is evoking strong emotional responses from the public, including calls for a ceasefire and more humanitarian aid.<br><a href="https://www.american.edu/sis/news/20231121-how-does-the-media-impact-public-perception-about-war.cfm" target="_blank">https://www.american.edu/sis/news/20231121-how-does-the-media-impact-public-perception-about-war.cfm</a></li><li id="tree-E3766844215"><strong>E3766844215:</strong> More than 750 journalists from various news organizations, including Reuters, the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Globe, and The Washington Post, signed an open letter condemning Israel’s killing of reporters in Gaza and criticizing the war coverage in Western media.

While Gaza is destroyed, tensions in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, remain high. The drastic acceleration in Israeli settlements and record high settler and State violence including extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, are worsening long-standing patterns of violence, oppression, discrimination and debilitating movement restrictions, leading to the forcible displacement of Palestinian communities, amid a continuing dire fiscal crisis facing the Palestinian Authority.

UNICEF continues to focus on needs of children for protection and humanitarian assistance. No safe place for children as humanitarian crisis deepens People walk past destroyed buildings in the centre of Gaza City. UNICEF remains on the ground, working with partners to provide supplies and support for children and families. But aid is not reaching every child in urgent need. Day after day, UNICEF and partners face three major challenges to reach those who need it most: Safety, logistics and restrictions on commercial goods. The ongoing conflict means that it’s incredibly difficult to move safely across the Gaza Strip and to gain access to children in need. UNICEF staff, along with our United Nations and civil society partners, remain in Gaza but must be allowed to provide life-saving aid at scale, especially where access is most constrained. UNICEF and partners have dispatched emergency supplies including water, life-saving medicines and equipment, but much more is needed to meet the immense needs of civilians.  · Around 1.9 million people in the Gaza Strip are estimated to have been internally displaced – half of them children.

The IRC is on the ground in Gaza, working to respond to the immense humanitarian crisis arising from the current conflict. UN Security Council Resolution 2735 calls for a three-phase ceasefire deal to end the war in Gaza. A ceasefire is necessary to facilitate the scale-up of humanitarian aid needed to address the needs of Palestinians and to secure the release of hostages. Since the war began, aid supply and distribution has been dangerously restricted by insecurity and Israel’s bureaucratic and logistical barriers. The IRC urges all parties to the conflict to implement all aspects of the resolution immediately.Read our June 14 release. ... The humanitarian suffering in Gaza is catastrophic. Even with an immediate ceasefire, almost 12,000 people would lose their lives in Gaza as a result of disease. Nearly 90,000 could die of secondary health impacts alone should the conflict escalate further. The flow of humanitarian aid supplies into Gaza has been slowed by insecurity, impediments and severe constraints, including restrictions on the movement between southern and northern Gaza. This represents just 11% of the aid trucks that entered Gaza before October 7. These trucks entered mainly via the Kerem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) land crossing. Frequent and prolonged closures at the Kerem Shalom and Rafah crossings have severely hampered the delivery of humanitarian aid.<br><a href="https://www.rescue.org/topic/gaza-crisis" target="_blank">https://www.rescue.org/topic/gaza-crisis</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S7710005995" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S2223752497"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S2223752497</h3><ul><li id="tree-S2223752497"><strong>S2223752497:</strong> Palestinian refugees in Gaza express desperation for refuge and question why neighboring countries are unwilling to accept them during the ongoing conflict.<ul><li id="tree-E5762955283"><strong>E5762955283:</strong> As desperate Palestinians in sealed-off Gaza try to find refuge under Israel’s relentless bombardment in retaliation for Hamas brutal Oct. 7 attack, many ask why neighboring Egypt or other Arab countries don’t take them in.

READ MORE: Israel’s call for Gaza evacuation raises fears of a mass exodus of refugees into Egypt Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi made his toughest remarks yet on Wednesday, saying the current war was not just aimed at fighting Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, “but also an attempt to push the civilian inhabitants to … migrate to Egypt.” He warned this could wreck peace in the region. Jordan’s King Abdullah II gave a similar message a day earlier, saying, “No refugees in Jordan, no refugees in Egypt.” · Their refusal is rooted in fear that Israel wants to force a permanent expulsion of Palestinians into their countries and nullify Palestinian demands for statehood. In the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 300,000 more Palestinians fled, mostly into Jordan.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all.

Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples. Neither approach can work by itself, Mitchell said in a recent discussion that explored whether a type of fund used to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland’s peace process could be applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. The fund’s independence in a fraught political context is a key benefit, said Joel Braunold, the executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace and an advocate for an international fund for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While international financing of NGOs is politically volatile in the Middle East, an independent and inclusive fund could gain legitimacy, via financing and political support from parties each side trusts, Braunold said.  · Father Josh Thomas, executive director of Kids4Peace, an interfaith youth movement working with Israelis and Palestinians, said it’s important to build a sense of hope in the face of so much despair, cynicism and negativity.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E9722247745"><strong>E9722247745:</strong> Snippet text not found for ID: E9722247745</li><li id="tree-S1985880169"><strong>S1985880169:</strong> The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) represents a significant grassroots effort aimed at fostering cooperation and peace between Israelis and Palestinians.<ul><li id="tree-E3673069937"><strong>E3673069937:</strong> ALLMEP is proud to announce a new season of Groundwork Learn More Season 3 is out now!

Accordingly, I am currently putting my energy into supporting joint Israeli-Palestinian groups such as Standing Together, a grassroots movement mobilizing Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel in pursuit of peace, equality, social, and climate justice. The group recently stated that it put together the largest protest against the Israeli assault on Gaza in Israel since the war began. Another group, the Parents Circle, is a joint Israeli-Palestinian organization of more than 600 families, all of whom have lost an immediate family member to the ongoing conflict. On December 7, J Street issued a statement on the war titled “Moment of Truth for Israel’s Government: Either Heed Biden Administration Limits or Lose U.S. Support for Military Operation.” In that statement, J Street makes clear that it “has been unwavering in support of Israel’s right—and the country’s moral obligation—to respond to this attack, to defend itself, and to ensure that Israeli civilians never again come under threat from Hamas’s terror stronghold in Gaza.” The organization added that it has been “unequivocal that Israel’s military response must accord with international law, centering the protection of civilians and the provision of requisite humanitarian assistance.” But its support for Israel’s military assault on Gaza is not without limits. J Street concluded its statement by warning that if it does “not see evidence soon that the government of Israel is, in fact, making meaningful changes to its conduct of the war and its attitudes regarding post-war arrangements, then J Street will no longer be able to provide our organizational support for the current military campaign.” It does not set a deadline for its demand that Biden and Congress call for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and an end to the siege on Gaza. Thus, it is unknown what J Street’s decision making process is which would result in it no longer supporting Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.  · If Not Now is a smaller group whose activists are younger.

Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples. Neither approach can work by itself, Mitchell said in a recent discussion that explored whether a type of fund used to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland’s peace process could be applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding.

The fund’s independence in a fraught political context is a key benefit, said Joel Braunold, the executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace and an advocate for an international fund for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While international financing of NGOs is politically volatile in the Middle East, an independent and inclusive fund could gain legitimacy, via financing and political support from parties each side trusts, Braunold said.  · Father Josh Thomas, executive director of Kids4Peace, an interfaith youth movement working with Israelis and Palestinians, said it’s important to build a sense of hope in the face of so much despair, cynicism and negativity.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E9722247745"><strong>E9722247745:</strong> Snippet text not found for ID: E9722247745</li><li id="tree-S5578570289"><strong>S5578570289:</strong> Grassroots efforts are essential for peacebuilding in the Israel-Gaza conflict, as highlighted by former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, who noted their importance alongside political leadership.<ul><li id="tree-E0067674879"><strong>E0067674879:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts ...

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

Relatedly, the Rafah crossing must be immediately reopened and aid scaled up through all other crossing points. ... Russian Federation, President of the Security Council for July, speaking in his national capacity, noting that sustainable and adequate provision of aid in Gaza is impossible, said that Gazans are on the brink of famine. For its part, the United States announced in June an additional $404 million in life-saving humanitarian aid to support Palestinian civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and the region. ... Slovenia, noting that the situation is not getting better in spite of four resolutions, the International Court of Justice order, the UN mechanism and various “assurances that we have received”, added: “We have no right to be surprised.” Famine in Gaza is human-made — a choice made by Hamas who is sacrificing its people and Israel not fulfilling its duty as the occupying Power, he said. Republic of Korea stressed that international law obliges Israel — not the UN or non-governmental organizations — to restore and ensure public order and safety in the Strip. “When aid cannot be delivered to civilians, the number of trucks crossing the border into Gaza is meaningless beyond mere statistics,” he observed. Further, while humanitarian assistance alone cannot meet needs, permissions for commercial goods should not lead to a decrease in the humanitarian cargo entering Gaza. When the floor opened, many Council members expressed alarm about the deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip and called on Israel to enable humanitarian aid delivery, in line with Council resolution 2720 (2023). That text demanded the parties to the conflict to allow the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale directly to Palestinian civilians throughout that territory and established the aforementioned mechanism for speeding up the provision of humanitarian relief consignments to Gaza.<br><a href="https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15757.doc.htm" target="_blank">https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15757.doc.htm</a></li><li id="tree-E8813599140"><strong>E8813599140:</strong> The situation in the Middle East grows more dire by the hour, with the war in Gaza raging and risking spiralling throughout the region, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres warned the Security Council today, calling for humanitarian aid without restrictions and an immediate ceasefire.

He condemned the murders of civilians; indiscriminate bombings; destruction of homes, hospitals and civil infrastructure; and the deprivation of water, food, electricity and fuel services to Gazans. “Nothing can justify these actions, which constitute collective punishment”, serious violations of international humanitarian law, and war crimes and crimes against humanity, he said. He demanded an immediate ceasefire and the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and an end to the rhetoric of war. Joining the Secretary-General to unequivocally condemn the incident at the Al Ahli Arab Hospital, she called for an investigation to be carried out so that the facts can be clarified, also stressing the need to protect civilians and investigate all violations of international law, so that the perpetrators can be brought to justice. She said her country is rapidly mobilizing additional funds for ICRC and the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to address the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza. It is imperative that adequate volumes of aid enter Gaza and that rapid, full, safe and unhindered access is allowed and facilitated in line with international humanitarian law. She noted that the use of force in self-defence must be necessary and proportionate with international humanitarian law, and respected by all parties. To achieve the protection of civilians, humanitarian workers and United Nations premises and personnel requires restraint on the part of Israel in the use of force.

But experts say the deliveries—first brokered by the U.S. and containing food, medicine, and other medical supplies—are a drop in the bucket of what Gazans need. Read More: The Gaza Healthcare System Is Reportedly on the Brink of Collapse · “It’s a glimmer of light but it’s not enough,” Juliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, tells TIME from Amman, Jordan, where she has recently moved to from East Jerusalem. “If we don't have fuel, Gaza will collapse. The people of Gaza will collapse, and the largest humanitarian operation which is run by UNRWA will come to a halt,” Touma says. At least 5,087 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began launching airstrikes in the enclave, which is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. But Gaza has long faced a humanitarian crisis; the Strip has been under a 16-year blockade before the latest escalation. As a result, 1.2 million Gazans were already relying on food assistance from UNRWA. The lack of electricity and fuel has left Gazans to ration three liters (0.79 gallons) of water per day for cleaning, cooking, and drinking, well below then the international standard of 15 liters (3.3 gallons) needed in an emergency situation, according to the World Health Organization. Before the Israel-Hamas war broke out, Gaza’s 2.2 million citizens required an average of 500 trucks of aid and fuel per day from a number of organizations. Such deliveries took place at Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing point, while the Erez crossing point was used by aid workers, a small number of Palestinians working in Israel, and Gazans with a permit to seek health services in Israel.<br><a href="https://time.com/6328025/gaza-humanitarian-aid-efforts/" target="_blank">https://time.com/6328025/gaza-humanitarian-aid-efforts/</a></li><li id="tree-E4053078611"><strong>E4053078611:</strong> He’ll talk about the horrific attacks of October 7th and Israel’s right to go after Hamas and those responsible, but also Israel’s added burden, just given that Hamas hides and operates amongst the civilian population — Israel’s fundamental responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Gaza and also to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.<br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/03/07/background-press-call-on-humanitarian-aid-for-gaza-ahead-of-the-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/03/07/background-press-call-on-humanitarian-aid-for-gaza-ahead-of-the-state-of-the-union/</a></li><li id="tree-E6006472711"><strong>E6006472711:</strong> Rebuilding efforts will require ... 2023-2024 Gaza war highlights the urgent need for immediate relief, sustained support, and a comprehensive approach to peacebuilding to alleviate the suffering of civilians and prevent future crises....<br><a href="https://www.anera.org/where-we-work/palestine/gaza/" target="_blank">https://www.anera.org/where-we-work/palestine/gaza/</a></li><li id="tree-E1563730357"><strong>E1563730357:</strong> Since the war began, Anera’s team in Gaza has delivered millions of humanitarian supplies by purchasing locally and by trucking in other aid.

As Israeli military forces continue air strikes on Gaza in retaliation for a surprise Hamas attack earlier this month, authorities confirmed on Wednesday that Palestinians should soon be receiving international humanitarian aid. As the International Committee of the Red Cross said on X, “Families are in the streets. The infrastructure has been devastated. Hospitals are overwhelmed.” The result is a humanitarian crisis the United Nations has called an “unprecedented catastrophe.” · On Wednesday, however, President Joe Biden confirmed while visiting Tel Aviv that his administration had reached an agreement with the Israeli government to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza through Egypt. As a registered member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the PRCS isn’t vetted in the same way other humanitarian groups often are, reporting mainly to its network administrators and the United Nations. PRCS workers perform all the duties Americans usually associate with the Red Cross, providing healthcare, social services, and emergency aid to those affected by violence and natural disasters. Under the agreement, which includes inspections to be carried out at undisclosed checkpoints, Israeli officials say they “will not thwart humanitarian supplies” through Egypt so long as it consists only of food, water, and medicine; aid through Israel itself is still blockaded.<br><a href="https://www.them.us/story/humanitarian-crisis-gaza-how-to-help" target="_blank">https://www.them.us/story/humanitarian-crisis-gaza-how-to-help</a></li><li id="tree-E2195604499"><strong>E2195604499:</strong> Anera’s team in Gaza has delivered many millions of humanitarian relief items since the war began on October 7, 2023.<br><a href="https://www.anera.org/does-aid-to-gaza-actually-reach-people-in-need/" target="_blank">https://www.anera.org/does-aid-to-gaza-actually-reach-people-in-need/</a></li><li id="tree-E4205361130"><strong>E4205361130:</strong> This inconsistent and inadequate aid flow falls well short of addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been ongoing for more than seven decades. Today, there are nearly 7 million Palestinian refugees around the world. In Gaza, an endless cycle of violence and the ensuing Israeli blockade have created decades of substantial humanitarian needs. Israeli authorities have also committed repeated abuses and violations against Palestinians in the West Bank, and the Palestinian authority in the West Bank are also responsible for significant human rights violations. Refugees International is calling for an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages, protection of civilians and aid workers, a robust famine relief plan, and restoration of support to UNRWA. The attack prompted a deadly Israeli military campaign on Gaza in response that has killed almost 40,000 Palestinians, injured more than 91,000 people, and displaced an estimated 1.9 million people among Gaza’s population of 2.1 million. An endless cycle of violence and failure to reach a hostage deal and ceasefire has created catastrophic humanitarian needs, including the high potential for famine, affecting both Palestinian civilians and the remaining hostages alike.<br><a href="https://www.refugeesinternational.org/palestine-israel/" target="_blank">https://www.refugeesinternational.org/palestine-israel/</a></li><li id="tree-E6212941075"><strong>E6212941075:</strong> For the refugees themselves, these situations mean they have reduced rights: no right to vote, limited property rights and access to social services, among other things.

Palestinians make several distinctions relating to Palestinian refugees. The 1948 refugees and their descendants are broadly defined as "refugees" (laji'un). The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), especially those who have returned and form part of the PNA, but also Palestinian refugee camp residents in Lebanon, repudiate this term, since it implies being a passive victim, and prefer the autonym of 'returnees' (a'idun). In 2003, nearly a hundred refugee organizations and NGOs in Lebanon denounced Shikaki's survey, as no local organization was aware of its implementation in Lebanon. In a 2 January 2005 opinion poll conducted by the Palestinian Association for Human Rights involving Palestinian refugees in Lebanon: As of 2019, more than 5.6 million Palestinians were registered with UNRWA as refugees, of which more than 1.5 million live in UNRWA-run camps.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

In response, Arab governments, civil society organizations, several media outlets, and some influential social media accounts were quick to condemn the violence and call for the protection of life on both sides. When governmental and nongovernmental voices ignored the targeting of Israeli civilians, their one-sided opinions were quickly marginalized. On October 26, as Israeli bombardment of Gaza intensified, nine Arab foreign ministers issued a statement reaffirming their opposition to violence and the killing of civilians. Protesters have emphasized U.S. and others’ unconditional support for Israel—despite a Palestinian death toll in the thousands, the destruction of critical civilian infrastructure, the displacement of over 1 million Palestinians within Gaza, and the obstruction of access to humanitarian aid. Scenes of protesters burning the Israeli and the U.S. flags and expressing sympathies to Hamas militants have surfaced on social media, but they account for a tiny fraction of the Arab street movement. They also highlighted the daily struggles of Palestinians in the West Bank due to the aggressive expansion of the Jewish settlements, in East Jerusalem because of the forced displacement, and in Gaza as a result of the inhumane siege. Despite a shocking trend to dehumanize Palestinians in Israeli media and policy circles, parallel narratives dehumanizing Israeli civilians have not gained in popularity among Arabs. This initial nonviolent and humanist response has held its ground with the emergence of pro-Palestine mass mobilization in several Arab countries. The Arab street has watched as the civilian population in Gaza falls victim to Israeli attacks and is left without international protection or aid amid a humanitarian catastrophe.<br><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/11/01/pay-attention-to-arab-public-response-to-israel-hamas-war-pub-90893" target="_blank">https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/11/01/pay-attention-to-arab-public-response-to-israel-hamas-war-pub-90893</a></li><li id="tree-E5405571697"><strong>E5405571697:</strong> The peaceful nature of the mass mobilization reflects a growing trend to renounce violence.<br><a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/11/01/pay-attention-to-arab-public-response-to-israel-hamas-war-pub-90893" target="_blank">https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/11/01/pay-attention-to-arab-public-response-to-israel-hamas-war-pub-90893</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S1625713582" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S6684951807"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S6684951807</h3><ul><li id="tree-S6684951807"><strong>S6684951807:</strong> Israel's social media campaigns are a strategic effort to shape public opinion about its military actions in Gaza, reflecting the influence of civil society on the narrative surrounding the conflict.<ul><li id="tree-E7290211814"><strong>E7290211814:</strong> Since Hamas’ attack, Israel has pushed dozens of online ads, including graphic videos, to millions of people to drum up support for its actions.

To seek peaceful resolution through action that prevents or alleviates human suffering, there must be no further attacks against civilians nor people who are there to assist vulnerable people, including humanitarian workers and UN peacekeepers. The Humanitarian Charter – which is part of the Sphere Handbook – states that ‘all people affected by disaster or conflict have a right to receive protection and assistance to ensure the basic conditions for life with dignity’. The Charter is based on international law and the fundamental moral principle of humanity, ‘that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights’. A prime concern, Raymond explains, is that ‘large amounts of civilians are trapped in a very small area with a high level of ongoing bombardment that is occurring in the midst of the collapse of Gaza’s ability to provide emergency healthcare and basic humanitarian assistance.’ · This is the immediate crisis. But it’s now combined with the creation of conditions on top of pre-conflict precarity that can produce secondary casualties from waterborne disease (such as cholera and dysentery), malnutrition, lack of clean water, and basically an inability for the population to effectively flee. In conflicts and crises, the weaponisation of medical and humanitarian aid not only violates the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality, but also erodes the basic rights of civilians to access essential healthcare and humanitarian assistance. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recently suggested that Israel’s actions ‘may be’ in violation of articles 55, 56 and 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention that obligates the protection of civilians in occupied territories.

Accordingly, I am currently putting my energy into supporting joint Israeli-Palestinian groups such as Standing Together, a grassroots movement mobilizing Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel in pursuit of peace, equality, social, and climate justice. The group recently stated that it put together the largest protest against the Israeli assault on Gaza in Israel since the war began. Another group, the Parents Circle, is a joint Israeli-Palestinian organization of more than 600 families, all of whom have lost an immediate family member to the ongoing conflict. On December 7, J Street issued a statement on the war titled “Moment of Truth for Israel’s Government: Either Heed Biden Administration Limits or Lose U.S. Support for Military Operation.” In that statement, J Street makes clear that it “has been unwavering in support of Israel’s right—and the country’s moral obligation—to respond to this attack, to defend itself, and to ensure that Israeli civilians never again come under threat from Hamas’s terror stronghold in Gaza.” The organization added that it has been “unequivocal that Israel’s military response must accord with international law, centering the protection of civilians and the provision of requisite humanitarian assistance.” But its support for Israel’s military assault on Gaza is not without limits. J Street concluded its statement by warning that if it does “not see evidence soon that the government of Israel is, in fact, making meaningful changes to its conduct of the war and its attitudes regarding post-war arrangements, then J Street will no longer be able to provide our organizational support for the current military campaign.” It does not set a deadline for its demand that Biden and Congress call for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and an end to the siege on Gaza. Thus, it is unknown what J Street’s decision making process is which would result in it no longer supporting Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.  · If Not Now is a smaller group whose activists are younger.

Goren says that Palestinians put in desperate situations are more likely to support groups like Hamas. “Being a peace activist in Israel is labeled these days as being a traitor, someone who cheers for the other team. People think you hate your own people, you are an auto-antisemite,” says Udi Goren, an Israeli photographer who opposes the war in Gaza.

Relatedly, the Rafah crossing must be immediately reopened and aid scaled up through all other crossing points. ... Russian Federation, President of the Security Council for July, speaking in his national capacity, noting that sustainable and adequate provision of aid in Gaza is impossible, said that Gazans are on the brink of famine. For its part, the United States announced in June an additional $404 million in life-saving humanitarian aid to support Palestinian civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and the region. ... Slovenia, noting that the situation is not getting better in spite of four resolutions, the International Court of Justice order, the UN mechanism and various “assurances that we have received”, added: “We have no right to be surprised.” Famine in Gaza is human-made — a choice made by Hamas who is sacrificing its people and Israel not fulfilling its duty as the occupying Power, he said. Republic of Korea stressed that international law obliges Israel — not the UN or non-governmental organizations — to restore and ensure public order and safety in the Strip. “When aid cannot be delivered to civilians, the number of trucks crossing the border into Gaza is meaningless beyond mere statistics,” he observed. Further, while humanitarian assistance alone cannot meet needs, permissions for commercial goods should not lead to a decrease in the humanitarian cargo entering Gaza. When the floor opened, many Council members expressed alarm about the deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip and called on Israel to enable humanitarian aid delivery, in line with Council resolution 2720 (2023).

But experts say the deliveries—first brokered by the U.S. and containing food, medicine, and other medical supplies—are a drop in the bucket of what Gazans need. Read More: The Gaza Healthcare System Is Reportedly on the Brink of Collapse · “It’s a glimmer of light but it’s not enough,” Juliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, tells TIME from Amman, Jordan, where she has recently moved to from East Jerusalem. “If we don't have fuel, Gaza will collapse. The people of Gaza will collapse, and the largest humanitarian operation which is run by UNRWA will come to a halt,” Touma says. At least 5,087 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began launching airstrikes in the enclave, which is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. But Gaza has long faced a humanitarian crisis; the Strip has been under a 16-year blockade before the latest escalation. As a result, 1.2 million Gazans were already relying on food assistance from UNRWA. The lack of electricity and fuel has left Gazans to ration three liters (0.79 gallons) of water per day for cleaning, cooking, and drinking, well below then the international standard of 15 liters (3.3 gallons) needed in an emergency situation, according to the World Health Organization. Before the Israel-Hamas war broke out, Gaza’s 2.2 million citizens required an average of 500 trucks of aid and fuel per day from a number of organizations. Such deliveries took place at Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing point, while the Erez crossing point was used by aid workers, a small number of Palestinians working in Israel, and Gazans with a permit to seek health services in Israel.<br><a href="https://time.com/6328025/gaza-humanitarian-aid-efforts/" target="_blank">https://time.com/6328025/gaza-humanitarian-aid-efforts/</a></li><li id="tree-E4053078611"><strong>E4053078611:</strong> He’ll talk about the horrific attacks of October 7th and Israel’s right to go after Hamas and those responsible, but also Israel’s added burden, just given that Hamas hides and operates amongst the civilian population — Israel’s fundamental responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Gaza and also to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.<br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/03/07/background-press-call-on-humanitarian-aid-for-gaza-ahead-of-the-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/03/07/background-press-call-on-humanitarian-aid-for-gaza-ahead-of-the-state-of-the-union/</a></li><li id="tree-E6006472711"><strong>E6006472711:</strong> Rebuilding efforts will require ... 2023-2024 Gaza war highlights the urgent need for immediate relief, sustained support, and a comprehensive approach to peacebuilding to alleviate the suffering of civilians and prevent future crises....<br><a href="https://www.anera.org/where-we-work/palestine/gaza/" target="_blank">https://www.anera.org/where-we-work/palestine/gaza/</a></li><li id="tree-E1563730357"><strong>E1563730357:</strong> Since the war began, Anera’s team in Gaza has delivered millions of humanitarian supplies by purchasing locally and by trucking in other aid.

Our 13 Gaza colleagues are working diligently, though they have been displaced from their homes and are staying in shelters with little food, water or electricity. Despite the very difficult circumstances, however, they are doing everything they can to deliver aid to their fellow Gazans, despite the dangers. This inconsistent and inadequate aid flow falls well short of addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. It is also important to note that the logistical hurdles to getting trucks into Gaza are formidable and convoluted. It is virtually impossible to ship goods through Israel proper, the way Anera and other international aid groups had done business in the past. Anera’s staff of four in the north spearheads humanitarian relief efforts on the ground. Since February 1, Anera has been providing 20,000 meals daily to families in Jabalia.

Hospitals are overwhelmed.” The result is a humanitarian crisis the United Nations has called an “unprecedented catastrophe.” · On Wednesday, however, President Joe Biden confirmed while visiting Tel Aviv that his administration had reached an agreement with the Israeli government to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza through Egypt. As a registered member of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the PRCS isn’t vetted in the same way other humanitarian groups often are, reporting mainly to its network administrators and the United Nations. PRCS workers perform all the duties Americans usually associate with the Red Cross, providing healthcare, social services, and emergency aid to those affected by violence and natural disasters.

Russian Federation, President of the Security Council for July, speaking in his national capacity, noting that sustainable and adequate provision of aid in Gaza is impossible, said that Gazans are on the brink of famine. For its part, the United States announced in June an additional $404 million in life-saving humanitarian aid to support Palestinian civilians in Gaza, the West Bank and the region. ... Slovenia, noting that the situation is not getting better in spite of four resolutions, the International Court of Justice order, the UN mechanism and various “assurances that we have received”, added: “We have no right to be surprised.” Famine in Gaza is human-made — a choice made by Hamas who is sacrificing its people and Israel not fulfilling its duty as the occupying Power, he said. Republic of Korea stressed that international law obliges Israel — not the UN or non-governmental organizations — to restore and ensure public order and safety in the Strip. “When aid cannot be delivered to civilians, the number of trucks crossing the border into Gaza is meaningless beyond mere statistics,” he observed. Further, while humanitarian assistance alone cannot meet needs, permissions for commercial goods should not lead to a decrease in the humanitarian cargo entering Gaza. When the floor opened, many Council members expressed alarm about the deteriorating situation in the Gaza Strip and called on Israel to enable humanitarian aid delivery, in line with Council resolution 2720 (2023).

But experts say the deliveries—first brokered by the U.S. and containing food, medicine, and other medical supplies—are a drop in the bucket of what Gazans need. Read More: The Gaza Healthcare System Is Reportedly on the Brink of Collapse · “It’s a glimmer of light but it’s not enough,” Juliette Touma, director of communications for UNRWA, tells TIME from Amman, Jordan, where she has recently moved to from East Jerusalem. “If we don't have fuel, Gaza will collapse. The people of Gaza will collapse, and the largest humanitarian operation which is run by UNRWA will come to a halt,” Touma says. At least 5,087 Palestinians have been killed since Israel began launching airstrikes in the enclave, which is one of the most densely populated places on Earth. But Gaza has long faced a humanitarian crisis; the Strip has been under a 16-year blockade before the latest escalation. As a result, 1.2 million Gazans were already relying on food assistance from UNRWA. The lack of electricity and fuel has left Gazans to ration three liters (0.79 gallons) of water per day for cleaning, cooking, and drinking, well below then the international standard of 15 liters (3.3 gallons) needed in an emergency situation, according to the World Health Organization. Before the Israel-Hamas war broke out, Gaza’s 2.2 million citizens required an average of 500 trucks of aid and fuel per day from a number of organizations. Such deliveries took place at Israel’s Kerem Shalom crossing point, while the Erez crossing point was used by aid workers, a small number of Palestinians working in Israel, and Gazans with a permit to seek health services in Israel.<br><a href="https://time.com/6328025/gaza-humanitarian-aid-efforts/" target="_blank">https://time.com/6328025/gaza-humanitarian-aid-efforts/</a></li><li id="tree-E4053078611"><strong>E4053078611:</strong> He’ll talk about the horrific attacks of October 7th and Israel’s right to go after Hamas and those responsible, but also Israel’s added burden, just given that Hamas hides and operates amongst the civilian population — Israel’s fundamental responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Gaza and also to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.<br><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/03/07/background-press-call-on-humanitarian-aid-for-gaza-ahead-of-the-state-of-the-union/" target="_blank">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2024/03/07/background-press-call-on-humanitarian-aid-for-gaza-ahead-of-the-state-of-the-union/</a></li><li id="tree-E6006472711"><strong>E6006472711:</strong> Rebuilding efforts will require ... 2023-2024 Gaza war highlights the urgent need for immediate relief, sustained support, and a comprehensive approach to peacebuilding to alleviate the suffering of civilians and prevent future crises....<br><a href="https://www.anera.org/where-we-work/palestine/gaza/" target="_blank">https://www.anera.org/where-we-work/palestine/gaza/</a></li><li id="tree-E1563730357"><strong>E1563730357:</strong> Since the war began, Anera’s team in Gaza has delivered millions of humanitarian supplies by purchasing locally and by trucking in other aid.

From Gaza to Ukraine, Haiti, Sudan, and Afghanistan, their numbers are going up, as geopolitical conflicts, climate change, health and food crises intensify. “Supporting grassroots women’s organizations in Palestine is critical,” said Syam. “Without adequate support and funding, these organizations may struggle to continue providing essential services.” The implications of such funding shortfall are dire in an already unprecedented crisis. It could cut off access to vital resources and without their advocacy efforts, the voices of many women in Gaza would go unheard. Yet, women-led and women’s rights organizations continue to operate, providing a lifeline to the communities where they work. UN Women’s analysis shows that 83 per cent of women’s organizations surveyed in the Gaza Strip are at least partially operational, mainly focusing on the emergency response. Syam also stressed on the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza and the provision of humanitarian aid, adding, “it is imperative to strengthen the role of civil society institutions, especially women’s organizations that have been working since the onset of the war, and to enhance partnership and coordination with international and UN agencies to make sure that gender issues are fully addressed in all humanitarian interventions.” More than 2 million Palestinians in Gaza face inhumane living conditions today.<br><a href="https://arabstates.unwomen.org/en/stories/feature-story/2024/03/womens-organizations-provide-a-lifeline-to-women-in-gaza" target="_blank">https://arabstates.unwomen.org/en/stories/feature-story/2024/03/womens-organizations-provide-a-lifeline-to-women-in-gaza</a></li><li id="tree-E4320770683"><strong>E4320770683:</strong> Yet, women-led and women’s rights organizations continue to operate, providing a lifeline to the communities where they work.

Neither approach can work by itself, Mitchell said in a recent discussion that explored whether a type of fund used to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland’s peace process could be applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Arguing for scaled-up investment, Thomas cited one of his Palestinian teenage participants. When asked what it would take to feel more confident and strong in his work as a young person pursuing a nonviolent path to peace, the youth simply replied “more people.” · Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, director of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict program, testified on July 21, 2021 at the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism's hearing on "People to People: Examining Grassroots Peacebuilding Efforts Between Israelis and Palestinians." Chairman Deutch, Ranking Member Wilson and members of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism, thank you for this opportunity to testify on grassroots peacebuilding efforts between Israelis and Palestinians. The timing of this hearing is critically important coming on the heels of the recent 11-day conflict between Israel and Hamas that was preceded by ongoing tensions and clashes in Jerusalem and violence between Jewish and Arab citizens of Israel. These recent events underscore the significance of the bipartisan Nita M. Lowey Middle East Partnership for Peace Act, a new law initiated by Congress to foster peaceful coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians. Ned Lazarus published his comprehensive study on the long-term impact of peace education participation among more than 800 Israeli and Palestinian participants of one of the early post-Oslo Accords peacebuilding organizations, ¬¬Seeds of Peace. His findings included that 17.5 percent of the first ten groups of Israeli and Palestinian participants were working for 40 different peacebuilding initiatives as adults. But Israelis and Palestinians do not have the luxury of waiting for diplomats and politicians to deliver a better tomorrow for them. They are living with the violence, the fear, the hatred, the tension, and the structural barriers to peace every day.  · While grassroots peacebuilding is not a substitute for a political process when it comes to formally ending the conflict, it cannot be dismissed as an afterthought or mere derivative of diplomatic goals.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2021/07/people-people-examining-grassroots-peacebuilding-efforts-between-israelis-and" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2021/07/people-people-examining-grassroots-peacebuilding-efforts-between-israelis-and</a></li><li id="tree-E1582902949"><strong>E1582902949:</strong> Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, director of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict program, testified on July 21, 2021 at the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism&#x27;s hearing on &quot;People to People: Examining Grassroots Peacebuilding Efforts Between ...<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2021/07/people-people-examining-grassroots-peacebuilding-efforts-between-israelis-and" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2021/07/people-people-examining-grassroots-peacebuilding-efforts-between-israelis-and</a></li><li id="tree-E7651591300"><strong>E7651591300:</strong> Lucy Kurtzer-Ellenbogen, director of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict program, testified on July 21, 2021 at the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism's hearing on "People to People: Examining Grassroots Peacebuilding Efforts Between Israelis and Palestinians."<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2021/07/people-people-examining-grassroots-peacebuilding-efforts-between-israelis-and" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2021/07/people-people-examining-grassroots-peacebuilding-efforts-between-israelis-and</a></li><li id="tree-E5127190355"><strong>E5127190355:</strong> But Israelis and Palestinians do not have the luxury of waiting for diplomats and politicians to deliver a better tomorrow for them.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

Of the four core issues to resolve for an Israeli-Palestinian peace (security, borders/settlements, Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees) it is the refugee question that gets the least attention by non-specialists. And it is the core issue least addressed publically in detail by Israeli and Palestinian leaders. There is also increasing commentary in Israel on the perceived dangers of sizable movement of Palestinian refugees into a new state of Palestine in a two-state solution. The argument is that Palestine would be unable to absorb many refugees and the resultant confusion and economic crisis could lead to a breakdown in security with a resultant threat to Israel. This initiative ended in 2008 when Olmert was forced from office. Palestinian attempts in those negotiations to accommodate some Israeli positions became public with the leak in January 2011 of the so-called Palestine Papers, the notes from internal and bilateral meetings with Israeli counterparts. These documents had their leaders open to accepting a very limited return of 10,000 refugees over 10 years and Abbas saying that large-scale return was illogical since that would mean the end of Israel. In May, a Senate amendment to the Foreign Operations bill sought to distinguish between those Palestinian refugees who were alive just after the 1948 war and were personally displaced and those born subsequently. Estimates of those still alive from 1948 range between 30 and 50 thousand, compared to the nearly five million now registered and the 1.5 million living in camps. Israeli news reports assert that this amendment was the result of an initiative by an Israeli parliamentarian.<br><a href="https://www.mei.edu/publications/israeli-palestinian-peace-palestinian-refugee-challenge" target="_blank">https://www.mei.edu/publications/israeli-palestinian-peace-palestinian-refugee-challenge</a></li><li id="tree-E2798703434"><strong>E2798703434:</strong> Of the four core issues to resolve for an Israeli-Palestinian peace (security, borders/settlements, Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees) it is the refugee question that gets the least attention by non-specialists.

Accordingly, I am currently putting my energy into supporting joint Israeli-Palestinian groups such as Standing Together, a grassroots movement mobilizing Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel in pursuit of peace, equality, social, and climate justice. The group recently stated that it put together the largest protest against the Israeli assault on Gaza in Israel since the war began. Another group, the Parents Circle, is a joint Israeli-Palestinian organization of more than 600 families, all of whom have lost an immediate family member to the ongoing conflict. On December 7, J Street issued a statement on the war titled “Moment of Truth for Israel’s Government: Either Heed Biden Administration Limits or Lose U.S. Support for Military Operation.” In that statement, J Street makes clear that it “has been unwavering in support of Israel’s right—and the country’s moral obligation—to respond to this attack, to defend itself, and to ensure that Israeli civilians never again come under threat from Hamas’s terror stronghold in Gaza.” The organization added that it has been “unequivocal that Israel’s military response must accord with international law, centering the protection of civilians and the provision of requisite humanitarian assistance.” But its support for Israel’s military assault on Gaza is not without limits. J Street concluded its statement by warning that if it does “not see evidence soon that the government of Israel is, in fact, making meaningful changes to its conduct of the war and its attitudes regarding post-war arrangements, then J Street will no longer be able to provide our organizational support for the current military campaign.” It does not set a deadline for its demand that Biden and Congress call for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and an end to the siege on Gaza. Thus, it is unknown what J Street’s decision making process is which would result in it no longer supporting Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.  · If Not Now is a smaller group whose activists are younger.

The report comes from researchers at the University Network for Human Rights, a consortium of human right centers 4. Is it reasonable to ask Israel to support any solution that does not include the unequivocal right to exist and their borders be recognized? %. What responsibility to Israel have to creating the current conditions in Gaza since the Nakba? These are fundamental aspects to this conflict that require more consideration. Akram: Between October 7, 2023, and May 1, 2024—the period covered in our report—Israel has killed at least 34,000 Palestinians and injured over 78,000 in Gaza, comprising over 5 percent of Gaza’s population. Of those killed, [around] 14,000 are children—more children in the first four months of Israel’s assault than have been killed in all the world’s conflicts in the last four years. Now, an “objective, methodological, and detailed analysis” conducted in part by the Boston University School of Law’s International Human Rights Clinic as part of a report from the University Network for Human Rights (UNHR), a consortium of human rights centers at colleges across the world, has released its finding. The UNHR report, released in mid-May, concludes: “Israel has committed genocidal acts, namely killing, seriously harming, and inflicting conditions of life calculated, and intended to, bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza,” says Susan Akram, a LAW clinical professor of law and director of LAW’s International Human Rights Clinic, who contributed to the report.<br><a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/is-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/" target="_blank">https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/is-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/</a></li><li id="tree-E4718111533"><strong>E4718111533:</strong> For decades, Israel has systematically violated its obligations under international law toward Palestinians, violating their rights and implementing a system of apartheid in the areas it controls.

But in Israel, the atrocities are still front and centre – while the destruction in Gaza is largely absent. As a result, the death toll in Gaza has so far had little impact on the Israeli Jewish public. The only thing animating some calls for a ceasefire deal now is the ongoing risk to the hostages and the sense of national responsibility for their fate.

In addition to bringing an end to the bloodshed in Gaza (to which the US alone holds the key), they must strive to earn trust on both sides of the fence. The world has largely moved on from the October 7 attacks, with many people’s memories now obscured by the daily footage of the carnage in Gaza. More than 28,000 Palestinians have been killed so far, and many more are still under the rubble. However, Israelis don’t see on their screens what the rest of the world sees.

The report comes from researchers at the University Network for Human Rights, a consortium of human right centers 4. Is it reasonable to ask Israel to support any solution that does not include the unequivocal right to exist and their borders be recognized? %. What responsibility to Israel have to creating the current conditions in Gaza since the Nakba? These are fundamental aspects to this conflict that require more consideration. Akram: Between October 7, 2023, and May 1, 2024—the period covered in our report—Israel has killed at least 34,000 Palestinians and injured over 78,000 in Gaza, comprising over 5 percent of Gaza’s population. Of those killed, [around] 14,000 are children—more children in the first four months of Israel’s assault than have been killed in all the world’s conflicts in the last four years. Now, an “objective, methodological, and detailed analysis” conducted in part by the Boston University School of Law’s International Human Rights Clinic as part of a report from the University Network for Human Rights (UNHR), a consortium of human rights centers at colleges across the world, has released its finding. The UNHR report, released in mid-May, concludes: “Israel has committed genocidal acts, namely killing, seriously harming, and inflicting conditions of life calculated, and intended to, bring about the physical destruction of Palestinians in Gaza,” says Susan Akram, a LAW clinical professor of law and director of LAW’s International Human Rights Clinic, who contributed to the report.<br><a href="https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/is-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/" target="_blank">https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/is-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza/</a></li><li id="tree-E4718111533"><strong>E4718111533:</strong> For decades, Israel has systematically violated its obligations under international law toward Palestinians, violating their rights and implementing a system of apartheid in the areas it controls.

Neither approach can work by itself, Mitchell said in a recent discussion that explored whether a type of fund used to promote reconciliation in Northern Ireland’s peace process could be applied to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The fund’s independence in a fraught political context is a key benefit, said Joel Braunold, the executive director of the Alliance for Middle East Peace and an advocate for an international fund for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While international financing of NGOs is politically volatile in the Middle East, an independent and inclusive fund could gain legitimacy, via financing and political support from parties each side trusts, Braunold said.  · Father Josh Thomas, executive director of Kids4Peace, an interfaith youth movement working with Israelis and Palestinians, said it’s important to build a sense of hope in the face of so much despair, cynicism and negativity. While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

Accordingly, I am currently putting my energy into supporting joint Israeli-Palestinian groups such as Standing Together, a grassroots movement mobilizing Jewish and Palestinian citizens of Israel in pursuit of peace, equality, social, and climate justice. The group recently stated that it put together the largest protest against the Israeli assault on Gaza in Israel since the war began. Another group, the Parents Circle, is a joint Israeli-Palestinian organization of more than 600 families, all of whom have lost an immediate family member to the ongoing conflict. On December 7, J Street issued a statement on the war titled “Moment of Truth for Israel’s Government: Either Heed Biden Administration Limits or Lose U.S. Support for Military Operation.” In that statement, J Street makes clear that it “has been unwavering in support of Israel’s right—and the country’s moral obligation—to respond to this attack, to defend itself, and to ensure that Israeli civilians never again come under threat from Hamas’s terror stronghold in Gaza.” The organization added that it has been “unequivocal that Israel’s military response must accord with international law, centering the protection of civilians and the provision of requisite humanitarian assistance.” But its support for Israel’s military assault on Gaza is not without limits. J Street concluded its statement by warning that if it does “not see evidence soon that the government of Israel is, in fact, making meaningful changes to its conduct of the war and its attitudes regarding post-war arrangements, then J Street will no longer be able to provide our organizational support for the current military campaign.” It does not set a deadline for its demand that Biden and Congress call for an immediate ceasefire, the release of hostages, and an end to the siege on Gaza. Thus, it is unknown what J Street’s decision making process is which would result in it no longer supporting Israel’s military campaign in Gaza.  · If Not Now is a smaller group whose activists are younger. Its members sometimes engage in protests and civil disobedience actions.

In moments of acute crisis, it is difficult to meaningfully respond in a way that rejects a militarized approach and affirms the dignity and humanity of those most affected by violence. As we are writing this briefing, an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the return of hostages, and rapid delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza are the only conditions by which negotiations for immediate de-escalation and long-term peace can be pursued. Achieving a peaceful resolution to the Israel-Palestine conflict requires a structural transformation in the relationship between Israel and Palestine. This transformation demands political leadership that is responsive to the genuine needs of all people. It should organically develop from the grassroots, amplifying the voices of Israeli and Palestinian peacebuilders dedicated to coexistence, justice, dignity, and freedom for all. There are countless concerned citizens, peace organizations, peace and security funders, and civil society organizations and their members deeply committed to advancing a more peaceful world. Their access to and ability to navigate complex and often distressing information is a powerful tool in this pursuit. However, the asymmetric war waged by Israel on Gaza in response to Hamas’s violence, the overflow of news, images, narratives, and expert opinions, particularly heightened through social media, can be overwhelming. The attacks by Hamas militants in Israel and the Israeli government’s war on Gaza are violent actions that do not represent the entirety of the viewpoints or policy preferences of Palestinian or Israeli people. There is no conflict where the most violent actors attain the full and unconditional support of the wider population. While pernicious and often appealing to the larger public, absolutist views and propaganda can be countered effectively by peace groups. This briefing is intended for the broader peace and security community in the U.S. to advocate for a peaceful and non-militarized solution to the war on Gaza. These recommendations may also be helpful for other conflict contexts or networks and organizations not identifying as peace and security stakeholders.<br><a href="https://warpreventioninitiative.org/2023/navigating-the-war-on-gaza/" target="_blank">https://warpreventioninitiative.org/2023/navigating-the-war-on-gaza/</a></li><li id="tree-S9722247745"><strong>S9722247745:</strong> The Alliance for Middle East Peace (ALLMEP) plays a crucial role in fostering cooperation and peace between Israelis and Palestinians through grassroots initiatives.<ul><li id="tree-E1296251176"><strong>E1296251176:</strong> MBI was formed in 2019 when Grassroots International joined forces with the Martín-Baró Fund for Mental Health and Human Rights.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all. Nonetheless, amid a stalled political and diplomatic process to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it is particularly important that governments, organizations and individuals maintain communication to keep the hope of peace alive, he said.<br><a href="https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict" target="_blank">https://www.usip.org/publications/2017/03/grassroots-work-israeli-palestinian-conflict</a></li><li id="tree-E6948553670"><strong>E6948553670:</strong> Former U.S. Senator George Mitchell, drawing on his experience negotiating the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland and trying for an accord between Israelis and Palestinians, said ending violent conflict requires two critical components: committed political leadership and grassroots efforts that build bridges between peoples.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding. Despite a common perception that grassroots peacebuilding has long been a large-scale funding priority in efforts to resolve the Israeli Palestinian conflict, Braunold said civil society was an afterthought of the first Oslo Accords of 1993, and peace and reconciliation didn’t feature at all.

While scores of non-governmental organizations in peacebuilding have been working over two decades to build cooperation between Israelis and Palestinians, they have done so without a broad model for steady funding and coordination like the IFI. Panelists broadly agreed increased and consistent funding could heighten the impact of Israeli and Palestinian grassroots peacebuilding.

A raft of measures to re-establish human rights, equality, accountability, and justice must be adopted across the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel. In these efforts, we count on our partnership with civil society. I wish to salute here civil society actors who work tirelessly to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need, who volunteer to take care of refugees traumatised by violence, who demand adherence to international law and standards from their governments, and who continue to campaign for a peaceful resolution to this conflict. While Gaza is destroyed, tensions in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, remain high. The drastic acceleration in Israeli settlements and record high settler and State violence including extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, are worsening long-standing patterns of violence, oppression, discrimination and debilitating movement restrictions, leading to the forcible displacement of Palestinian communities, amid a continuing dire fiscal crisis facing the Palestinian Authority. As a result of attacks on hospitals and medical personnel and the sustained interference with humanitarian assistance, Palestinians in Gaza are dying of disease and hunger, if they are not killed by bombs. Almost half a year has passed since the violent attacks of 7 and 8 October by Al-Qassam and other Palestinian armed groups, including horrific attacks on civilians, which resulted in the killing of nearly 1,200 Israeli and foreign citizens, injuries to over 5,000 others, with reports of torture and sexual violence, and the abduction of over 230 hostages into Gaza, of which around 130 hostages remain captive to date.<br><a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2024/04/civil-society-and-civilians-must-be-protected-harrowing-gaza" target="_blank">https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements-and-speeches/2024/04/civil-society-and-civilians-must-be-protected-harrowing-gaza</a></li><li id="tree-E8928070822"><strong>E8928070822:</strong> A raft of measures to re-establish human rights, equality, accountability, and justice must be adopted across the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel.

There is little patience for the peace movement in Israel following Hamas' unprecedented attack on Oct. 7.

The war against Hamas is backed by nearly all corners of Israeli society. Goren says that Israel’s blockade of Gaza and ongoing airstrikes are putting many Gazan citizens in a desperate situation, not to mention a death toll that has surpassed 5,000. Goren says that Palestinians put in desperate situations are more likely to support groups like Hamas. “Being a peace activist in Israel is labeled these days as being a traitor, someone who cheers for the other team.

The course will focus on the development and impact assessment of conflict resolution programs in the current Israeli-Palestinian context. Nearly six months after Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, tensions in two key flashpoints — Lebanon and Syria — continue to rise with significant Israeli airstrikes in both countries, leading to the highest death tolls in each country since October 7. Amid these rising tensions, ongoing clashes between the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) threaten to escalate into a wider war. At the same time, Lebanon continues to reel from a series of crises that have unfolded over the past four and a half years, highlighting Lebanon’s perilous position as the Gaza conflict continues to reverberate throughout the region. ... On March 25, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed Resolution 2728, calling for an “immediate” cease-fire in Gaza. The Middle East is entering a new phase after unprecedented attacks by Israel and Iran during the first two weeks of April.

Tell Congress: Call for a cease-fire and humanitarian access in Gaza now!: Urge them to insist that Israel adhere to international humanitarian and human rights law and call for a permanent cease-fire to end Israel's bombing of Gaza.

The conflict came to an end on 18 January after first Israel and then Hamas announced unilateral ceasefires. On 21 January, Israel completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. On 2 March, it was reported that international donors had pledged $4.5 billion in aid for the Palestinians, mainly for rebuilding Gaza after Israel's offensive. Some 300 Palestinians had been targeted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip since the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit. In July 2006, first reports emerged about mystery injuries after Israeli attacks. Previously unseen injuries included severely damaged internal organs, severe internal burning and deep internal wounds often resulting in amputations or death. Israel's decision to cut fuel supplies to Gaza were widely condemned (including by the European Union) as "collective punishment." Israel has also arrested Hamas officials in the West Bank, including two cabinet members. Such arrests have been strongly condemned by international organizations and politicians. The international condemnation of Israeli incursion was further augmented with a scathing report prepared by eight British-based rights organizations, highlighting humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip that reached its worst point since Israel captured the territory in 1967. In response to the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict, to the interdiction of the activity of the Moslem Brothers in Egypt and to what he interpreted as Egyptian support for Israel, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi an "illegitimate tyrant".
