    - Modeling of polystyrene nanoparticle interactions with model membranes.
    - Revealed mechanism of nanoparticle absorption into lipid bilayers.

    - Demonstrated the role of protein corona in modulating nanoparticle-membrane interactions.
    - Showed that corona proteins can facilitate or hinder membrane penetration depending on their composition.

- Experimental findings on MNP transport across the BBB:
  - Size-dependent BBB penetration of polystyrene nanoparticles [Raghnaill et al., 2014]:
    - Particles <100 nm in diameter showed significantly higher BBB penetration.
    - 40 nm particles showed 3-fold higher brain accumulation compared to 100 nm particles.
  - Influence of surface charge on BBB crossing [Lockman et al., 2004]:
    - Neutral and low concentrations of anionic nanoparticles had higher BBB penetration.
    - Cationic nanoparticles showed 3-5 times lower BBB penetration compared to neutral particles.

- Computational insights into MNP-BBB interactions:
  - Free energy profiles of nanoparticle-membrane interactions [Salassi et al., 2017]:
    - Energy barrier for nanoparticle penetration into lipid bilayers calculated.
    - Barrier height increases with nanoparticle size, from ~20 kJ/mol for 1 nm particles to ~100 kJ/mol for 5 nm particles.
  - Effect of corona proteins on nanoparticle-membrane interactions [Runa et al., 2019]:
    - Simulations showed that specific corona proteins can reduce the energy barrier for membrane penetration by 30-50%.
    - Protein unfolding and insertion into the membrane facilitate nanoparticle translocation.

- Challenges and limitations of current approaches:
  - In vitro models may not fully recapitulate the complexity of the in vivo BBB [Helms et al., 2016].
  - Limited resolution and sensitivity of in vivo imaging techniques for detecting small MNPs [Kenesei et al., 2019].
  - Computational models often simplify the complexity of biological systems and may not capture all relevant interactions [Rossi et al., 2014]."""
