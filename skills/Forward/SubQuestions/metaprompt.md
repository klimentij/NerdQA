1. The prompt should ask the user to provide an original complex question and any search results returned so far from the Bravo Search API for that question.

2. The prompt should instruct the language model to generate a specific number of subquestions (determined by a variable) that break down the original question into more focused queries. These subquestions should be used to research the key aspects and nuances of the original question using a search engine like Google.

3. Before generating the subquestions, the language model should be instructed to analyze the original question and the provided search results. It should reflect on what sub-areas need to be researched further to gather all the missing information required to comprehensively answer the original question.

4. The language model should be asked to provide its reflection in 5 paragraphs, considering the main topic, key aspects, sub-topics, additional information needed, and how to phrase the subquestions as effective search queries.

5. The generated subquestions should be wrapped in <subquestions> tags, with each individual subquestion enclosed in its own <subquestion> tags.

6. All variables in the prompt should be enclosed in double curly braces, i.e., {{variable}}.

7. The prompt should be open to further improvements and optimizations.

8. The subquestions generated by the language model will be used as Google search queries by a small language model to collect the missing information needed to thoroughly address the original question.
