#### Statement 2

**Statement:** The Russian government's crackdown on free speech is part of a larger trend of civil society repression that has escalated since the 2011-2012 protests, leading to significant restrictions on freedom of expression.

**Evidence:**
- s17247740156399230: The Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information.
- s17247740156391900: Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online. Authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens on criminal charges for social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews. Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term.

**Support Score:** 0.92

**Explanation:** The evidence describes a clampdown on free speech in Russia as part of a broader crackdown on civil society, initiated after mass protests in 2011-2012. This context illustrates the ongoing legal and societal pressures that inhibit free expression.

#### Statement 3

**Statement:** Although the Russian Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the practical application of law allows the government to suppress any speech lacking official support, resulting in widespread self-censorship among media outlets.

**Evidence:**
- s17247740156400250: As of 2023, Russia ranked 164 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Despite the constitution's provision of freedom of speech, the authorities possess significant discretion to suppress any speech, organization, or activity lacking official support due to ambiguous extremism laws.
- s17247740156405178: The Russian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; however, government application of law, bureaucratic regulation, and politically motivated criminal investigations have forced the press to exercise self-censorship constraining its coverage of certain controversial issues, resulting in infringements of these rights.

**Support Score:** 0.93

**Explanation:** The evidence highlights that despite constitutional provisions for freedom of speech, the Russian government exercises significant control over speech through vague extremism laws and bureaucratic regulation, leading to self-censorship among the press.

#### Statement 4

**Statement:** Since the invasion of Ukraine, Russia has expanded laws that suppress dissent, significantly curtailing freedom of speech and assembly for critics of the government.

**Evidence:**
- s17247740156405350: Dissent is not tolerated in Vladimir Putin's Russia. For years Kremlin critics have faced a host of laws which could be used against them, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that toolbox of measures has swelled in size. The laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia's constitution.
- s17247740156409618: In April 2023, prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail on charges of treason and spreading "false information" about the Russian army. His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools.

**Support Score:** 0.94

**Explanation:** The evidence indicates that dissent is not tolerated in Russia, with laws targeting freedom of speech and assembly being expanded since the invasion of Ukraine, which has led to increased repression of critics.

Between 2014 and 2016, approximately 85 percent of convictions for “extremist expression” dealt with online expression, with punishments ranging from fines or community service to prison time. In the period between September 2015 and February 2017, the number of people who went to jail for extremist speech spiked from 54 to 94.
