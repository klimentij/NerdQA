Political Polarization U.S. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors pursuing more than 600 criminal cases are relying on evidence gathered from social media accounts used to organize the attempt by Trump supporters to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s victory. A report we recently published through the Center for Business and Human Rights at New York University’s Stern School of Business sheds light on the relationship between tech platforms and the kind of extreme polarization that can lead to the erosion of democratic values and partisan violence. Staying off the platform “significantly reduced polarization of views on policy issues,” researchers found, although it didn’t diminish divisiveness based strictly on party identity. “That’s consistent with the view that people are seeing political content on social media that does tend to make them more upset, more angry at the other side [and more likely] to have stronger views on specific issues,” Matthew Gentzkow, a Stanford economist and co-author of the study, told us in an interview.<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/</a></li><li id="tree-E5219278088"><strong>E5219278088:</strong> Contrary to Facebook’s contentions, however, a range of experts have concluded that the use of social media contributes to partisan animosity in the U.S. In an article published in October 2020 in the journal Science, a group of 15 researchers summarized the scholarly consensus this way: “In recent years, social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have played an influential role in political discourse, intensifying political sectarianism.” In August 2021, a separate quintet of researchers summed up their review of the empirical evidence in an article in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences: “Although social media is unlikely to be the main driver of polarization, they concluded, “we posit that it is often a key facilitator.”<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/</a></li><li id="tree-E8385632859"><strong>E8385632859:</strong> It can also threaten mental health, ... to an “us vs. them” mindset.

In our instant information environment, informed by algorithms that send the most shocking, outrageous or emotional comments viral, social media is designed to do the exact opposite of bringing unity: it’s a polarisation engine. The question is what Keir Starmer will do. Ebner points to the fact that this is no longer about dark corners of the internet: politicians are among those who have been radicalised. “Politicians have to stop saying ‘the real world’ as opposed to the ‘online world’,” Ressa said. “How many times do we have to say it? “It’s very, very similar across the world and in different countries with a rise in far-right politics.

Social media are polarizing not because they isolate us with likeminded others, as often thought, but because they provide spaces where we create social identities that increasingly align with our political preferences. ‘This drives conflict and creates an all-encompassing division between two homogeneous and opposed political tribes’, concludes digital geographer Petter Törnberg in a new study. There is broad and general agreement that the rise of digital media, like Facebook and Twitter, has intensified polarization and made politics more conflictual. But there is less agreement around the causal mechanism. Why do digital media lead to political polarization? Törnberg links social media to the partisan sorting that underlies polarization. He uses an agent-based computational model to make visible how changes in the structure of interaction affects the social identities of individuals. ‘Such models combine empirical data that are already available and examine how these are linked to capture a causal mechanism’, explains Törnberg. According to Törnberg, we must first rethink the nature of political polarization if we are to understand the role of digital media. ‘There has been a tendency to think of polarization as opinions becoming more and more different. But political scientists are increasingly finding that polarization today is characterized not by political disagreement, but by a growing emotional sense of difference and dislike.<br><a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/faculteiten/en/faculteit-der-maatschappij-en-gedragswetenschappen/news/2022/10/social-media-polarize-politics-for-a-different-reason-than-you-might-think.html" target="_blank">https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/faculteiten/en/faculteit-der-maatschappij-en-gedragswetenschappen/news/2022/10/social-media-polarize-politics-for-a-different-reason-than-you-might-think.html</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S0113963453" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S8757580446"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S8757580446</h3><ul><li id="tree-S8757580446"><strong>S8757580446:</strong> Social media algorithms exacerbate political polarization by favoring divisive content and misinformation, reinforcing confirmation bias and groupthink among users.<ul><li id="tree-E9938062031"><strong>E9938062031:</strong> Meanwhile, federal prosecutors pursuing more than 600 criminal cases are relying on evidence gathered from social media accounts used to organize the attempt by Trump supporters to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s victory.

In this era of political polarization, many accuse online social media platforms such as Twitter of liberal bias, intentionally favoring and amplifying liberal content and users while suppressing other political content. But a new Indiana University study finds this is not the case. Political biases, the researchers found, stem from the social interactions of our accounts—we receive content closely aligned with whatever our online friends produce, especially our very first online friends. Because the drifters were designed to be neutral, the partisan nature of the content they consumed and produced reflects biases in the “online information ecosystem” created by user interactions, according to Menczer. “Online influence is affected by the echo-chamber characteristics of the social network,” he says. “Drifters following more partisan news sources received more politically aligned followers, becoming embedded in denser echo chambers.” “Our main finding is that the information Twitter users see in their news feed depends on the political leaning of their earliest connections,” said study co-author Filippo Menczer. “We found no evidence of intentional interference by the platform. Instead, bias can be explained by the use, and abuse, of the platform by its users.” The study, “Neutral bots probe political bias on social media,” is published online in the journal Nature Communications. The authors are a team of researchers from the Observatory on Social Media (OSoMe, pronounced awesome) at IU Bloomington, led by Menczer, who is director of OSoMe and a Luddy Distinguished Professor of informatics and computer science at the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering.

When it comes to the content that users interact with, a study by Sounman Hong and Sun Hyoung Kim published in Government Information Quarterly found that politicians with more extreme ideologies garnered more followers on Twitter (Hong and Kim 2016). The beliefs of these politicians, whether left or right, reinforce the views of the social media groups that already support them, thus reinforcing the perceived realities within these groups and contributing to the movement towards more extreme positions. Rather than reevaluate the information that was labeled as misleading or the source from which it came, conservatives find it easier to blame censorship because all the information they interact with creates a heavy bias and a skewed reality perception. While these statistics are specific to Republicans, this behavior is not unique to Republicans or conservative Americans, it is simply due to the effect that social media has on users. This cherry-picking of information doesn’t even require a reliance on confirmation bias and pits one group’s version of reality against the other’s, causing both to seek out other people and information to support their positions. Another contributor to this divide is the perceived censorship of conservative viewpoints by social media companies. Among Republicans, 90% believe that social media sites likely censor political viewpoints (Vogels et al. In a perfect world, platforms like Facebook would flag and remove extremist users and groups; however, as has been seen, it is difficult to control or regulate a company as large as Facebook.

In our instant information environment, informed by algorithms that send the most shocking, outrageous or emotional comments viral, social media is designed to do the exact opposite of bringing unity: it’s a polarisation engine. The question is what Keir Starmer will do. Ebner points to the fact that this is no longer about dark corners of the internet: politicians are among those who have been radicalised. “Politicians have to stop saying ‘the real world’ as opposed to the ‘online world’,” Ressa said. “How many times do we have to say it? “It’s very, very similar across the world and in different countries with a rise in far-right politics.

Social media are polarizing not because they isolate us with likeminded others, as often thought, but because they provide spaces where we create social identities that increasingly align with our political preferences. ‘This drives conflict and creates an all-encompassing division between two homogeneous and opposed political tribes’, concludes digital geographer Petter Törnberg in a new study. There is broad and general agreement that the rise of digital media, like Facebook and Twitter, has intensified polarization and made politics more conflictual. But there is less agreement around the causal mechanism. Why do digital media lead to political polarization? Törnberg links social media to the partisan sorting that underlies polarization. He uses an agent-based computational model to make visible how changes in the structure of interaction affects the social identities of individuals. ‘Such models combine empirical data that are already available and examine how these are linked to capture a causal mechanism’, explains Törnberg. According to Törnberg, we must first rethink the nature of political polarization if we are to understand the role of digital media. ‘There has been a tendency to think of polarization as opinions becoming more and more different. But political scientists are increasingly finding that polarization today is characterized not by political disagreement, but by a growing emotional sense of difference and dislike.<br><a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/faculteiten/en/faculteit-der-maatschappij-en-gedragswetenschappen/news/2022/10/social-media-polarize-politics-for-a-different-reason-than-you-might-think.html" target="_blank">https://www.uva.nl/en/shared-content/faculteiten/en/faculteit-der-maatschappij-en-gedragswetenschappen/news/2022/10/social-media-polarize-politics-for-a-different-reason-than-you-might-think.html</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S3466687973" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S2515783850"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S2515783850</h3><ul><li id="tree-S2515783850"><strong>S2515783850:</strong> Social media algorithms exacerbate political polarization by favoring content that aligns with users' existing biases, leading to the reinforcement of confirmation bias and groupthink.<ul><li id="tree-E5936778366"><strong>E5936778366:</strong> Before policymakers jump straight to regulating social media to address alleged bias—and likely running into First Amendment issues—they need answers to several key questions, namely: Is there political bias on social media? What does this bias look like? However, some individuals and organizations argue that rather than being biased against conservatives, mainstream social media platforms actually amplify conservative users and content above their liberal counterparts. The progressive non-profit research center Media Matters has published multiple studies of engagement on Facebook pages that regularly post about American political news, finding in 2019 that right-leaning and left-leaning pages earn similar interactions and, in 2020, that right-leaning pages earned more interactions. One study by NYU Stern did not find evidence of such bias, concluding that claims of bias were “based on distortions and falsehoods.” On the contrary, it found that conservative politicians and media outlets were often more successful than their liberal counterparts at generating social media interactions. There is some research into whether mainstream social media platforms are politically biased, but not enough to reach a conclusion that proves bias one way or another or disprove allegations of bias entirely. Contributing to this problem is a lack of insight into how content moderation takes place on these platforms. This could be a result of biased algorithms, but it just as easily could be a result of user behavior. In 2021, Twitter itself examined tweets from elected officials in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, and Japan and found that in all of these countries but Germany, tweets from right-wing politicians were amplified more than those from left-wing politicians, and this effect was greater on an algorithmic timeline than a chronological one.<br><a href="https://itif.org/publications/2023/10/26/the-facts-behind-allegations-of-political-bias-on-social-media/" target="_blank">https://itif.org/publications/2023/10/26/the-facts-behind-allegations-of-political-bias-on-social-media/</a></li><li id="tree-E2800530690"><strong>E2800530690:</strong> In this era of political polarization, many accuse online social media platforms such as Twitter of liberal bias, intentionally favoring and amplifying liberal content and users while suppressing other political content.

Staying off the platform “significantly reduced polarization of views on policy issues,” researchers found, although it didn’t diminish divisiveness based strictly on party identity. “That’s consistent with the view that people are seeing political content on social media that does tend to make them more upset, more angry at the other side [and more likely] to have stronger views on specific issues,” Matthew Gentzkow, a Stanford economist and co-author of the study, told us in an interview.<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/</a></li><li id="tree-E5219278088"><strong>E5219278088:</strong> Contrary to Facebook’s contentions, however, a range of experts have concluded that the use of social media contributes to partisan animosity in the U.S. In an article published in October 2020 in the journal Science, a group of 15 researchers summarized the scholarly consensus this way: “In recent years, social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have played an influential role in political discourse, intensifying political sectarianism.” In August 2021, a separate quintet of researchers summed up their review of the empirical evidence in an article in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences: “Although social media is unlikely to be the main driver of polarization, they concluded, “we posit that it is often a key facilitator.”<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/</a></li><li id="tree-E8385632859"><strong>E8385632859:</strong> It can also threaten mental health, ... to an “us vs. them” mindset. Media and social media amplify polarization through echo chambers and the spread of divisive content and misinformation.... These social groups could be based on religion, sexual orientation, race, or gender. This model has gained traction in modern politics because it helps explain the partisan stability seen in modern politics irrespective of short-term economic results or policy shifts. The drawbacks are obvious: erosion of democratic institutions and principles, increasing political polarization, legislative gridlock, confirmation bias, irrational policy-making, dehumanization of opponents, and so on. Furthermore, political tensions can amplify harassment and bullying – especially online where the illusion of anonymity emboldens otherwise reticent critics. Social media algorithms exacerbate this by spreading divisive content and misinformation as well as creating echo chambers. This reinforces groupthink and preconceived biases among voters. Clinical Relevance: Political polarization exacerbates social divisions and erodes trust in democratic institutions. It can also threaten mental health, causing stress and sleep loss. Social Identity Theory explains in-group cohesion and out-group discrimination, contributing to an “us vs. them” mindset. Media and social media amplify polarization through echo chambers and the spread of divisive content and misinformation. Group-level psychological processes relate to the Social Identity Theory of partisan politics. Therefore, it supports the belief that group identity, intergroup dynamics, and group norms play a larger role in political and ideological stance than individual belief. None of these theories are objectively wrong. Neither are they right. The political spectrum is significantly more nuanced than most politicians and media outlets would have voters believe. This sense of “false polarization” reduces inter-partisan cooperation and benefits political parties because it offers a stable voting base, distracts voters from crucial issues, and creates a political system based on simplified ideological heuristics instead of a nuanced approach that defines true policy-making.<br><a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/the-psychology-of-political-polarization/" target="_blank">https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/the-psychology-of-political-polarization/</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S3611913035" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S7541529665"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S7541529665</h3><ul><li id="tree-S7541529665"><strong>S7541529665:</strong> Social media algorithms that favor in-party content over out-party hostility contribute to the reinforcement of cognitive biases among users, leading to increased political polarization.<ul><li id="tree-E6788872117"><strong>E6788872117:</strong> Looks like Kamala Harris' campaign is getting it right when it comes to social media, according to a new study.

How the polarizing effect of social media is speeding up In his new book, journalist Max Fisher unpacks how social media companies have engineered our feeds to keep us angry, and keep us online. Spending more time on social media will make you significantly more polarized, it will make you have a much sharper view of people in the other party, or maybe people who just support another figure within the political party that you support, it will make you have harsher views towards outgroups generally, and it will make you more prone to internally feeling in your in your own self outrage and moral outrage. But in fact, what you were seeing, and what you were experiencing, are choices made by these incredibly sophisticated automated systems that are designed to figure out exactly what combination of posts, what way to sequence those posts, how to present them to you will most engage certain very specific cognitive triggers and cognitive weak points that are meant to get certain emotions going. In his new book, The Chaos Machine, Fisher details how the polarizing effect of social media is speeding up.<br><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121295499/facebook-twitter-youtube-instagram-tiktok-social-media" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121295499/facebook-twitter-youtube-instagram-tiktok-social-media</a></li><li id="tree-E9090671465"><strong>E9090671465:</strong> Two new studies say there&#x27;s no evidence of political learning on social media, but it does increasingly teach us to hate our opponents. In his new article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he argues that digital media are driving affective polarization by enhancing the process of partisan sorting. Affective polarization is defined as the difference between positive in-group bias toward the party someone supports and negative out-group bias toward other parties. "Social conflict is sustainable as long as there are multiple and non-overlapping lines of disagreement: we may differ on our views on one issue but agree on another; we may vote differently, but if we support the same football team or go to the same church, there remains space for interpersonal respect," writes Törnberg. "The recent rise in polarization is thus expressive of a gradual breakdown of this cohesive glue, driven by a gradual alignment of social, economic, geographic, and ideological differences and conflicts." The paradoxical conclusion of his analysis is it "suggests that attempts of media platforms to reduce polarization by acting against echo chambers—algorithmically increasing exposure to opposing ideas—may backfire, instead resulting in intensified polarization and conflict." "By connecting individuals with others from outside their local social bubbles, digital media pressure local political cultures to align globally," he argues. "Over time, the system comes to sort on the global scale, with a single political culture becoming system-wide."

At the group level, in-group bias and a tendency to associate with like-minded or similar people can produce echo chambers and information silos that can create and reinforce misinformation beliefs. At the societal level, public figures like politicians and celebrities can disproportionately influence public opinions, as can mass media outlets. A social media app called Parler has caused much chaos as well. Right winged Twitter users who were banned on the app moved to Parler after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, and the app was being used to plan and facilitate more illegal and dangerous activities. Google and Apple later pulled the app off their respective app stores. This app has been able to cause a lot of misinformation and bias in the media, allowing for more political mishaps. Social media has made information readily available to society at anytime, and it connects vast groups of people along with their information at one time. Advances in technology have impacted the way people communicate information and the way misinformation is spread. Misinformation can influence people's beliefs about communities, politics, medicine, and more. This growth of consumer choice when it comes to news media allows the consumer to choose a news source that may align with their biases, which consequently increases the likelihood that they are misinformed. 47% of Americans reported social media as their main news source in 2017 as opposed to traditional news sources. Misinformation was a major talking point during the 2016 U.S. presidential election with claims of social media sites allowing "fake news" to be spread. The Liar's Dividend describes a situation in which individuals are so concerned about realistic misinformation (in particular, deepfakes) that they begin to mistrust real content, particularly if someone claims that it is false. For instance, a politician could benefit from claiming that a real video of them doing something embarrassing was actually AI-generated or altered, leading followers to mistrust something that was actually real.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation</a></li><li id="tree-E0595005566"><strong>E0595005566:</strong> This growth of consumer choice when it comes to news media allows the consumer to choose a news source that may align with their biases, which consequently increases the likelihood that they are misinformed. 47% of Americans reported social media as their main news source in 2017 as opposed to traditional news sources.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation</a></li><li id="tree-S6604865816"><strong>S6604865816:</strong> Social media platforms contribute to political polarization by amplifying partisan animosity and facilitating echo chambers, which reinforce in-group biases and out-group hostility.<ul><li id="tree-E7882345956"><strong>E7882345956:</strong> Widespread use of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media has fueled the fire of extreme polarization, Paul Barrett, Justin Hendrix, and Grant Sims write.

Staying off the platform “significantly reduced polarization of views on policy issues,” researchers found, although it didn’t diminish divisiveness based strictly on party identity. “That’s consistent with the view that people are seeing political content on social media that does tend to make them more upset, more angry at the other side [and more likely] to have stronger views on specific issues,” Matthew Gentzkow, a Stanford economist and co-author of the study, told us in an interview.<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/</a></li><li id="tree-E5219278088"><strong>E5219278088:</strong> Contrary to Facebook’s contentions, however, a range of experts have concluded that the use of social media contributes to partisan animosity in the U.S. In an article published in October 2020 in the journal Science, a group of 15 researchers summarized the scholarly consensus this way: “In recent years, social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have played an influential role in political discourse, intensifying political sectarianism.” In August 2021, a separate quintet of researchers summed up their review of the empirical evidence in an article in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences: “Although social media is unlikely to be the main driver of polarization, they concluded, “we posit that it is often a key facilitator.”<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-tech-platforms-fuel-u-s-political-polarization-and-what-government-can-do-about-it/</a></li><li id="tree-E8385632859"><strong>E8385632859:</strong> It can also threaten mental health, ... to an “us vs. them” mindset.

There is mounting concern that social media sites contribute to political polarization by creating “echo chambers” that insulate people from opposing views about current events. We surveyed a large sample of Democrats and Republicans who visit Twitter at least three times each week about a range of social policy issues. Democrats exhibited slight increases in liberal attitudes after following a conservative Twitter bot, although these effects are not statistically significant. Notwithstanding important limitations of our study, these findings have significant implications for the interdisciplinary literature on political polarization and the emerging field of computational social science. America’s cavernous partisan divides are often attributed to “echo chambers,” or patterns of information sharing that reinforce preexisting political beliefs by limiting exposure to opposing political views (16–20). Concern about selective exposure to information and political polarization has increased in the age of social media (16, 21–23). Despite initial optimism that social media might enable people to consume more heterogeneous sources of information about current events, there is growing concern that such forums exacerbate political polarization because of social network homophily, or the well-documented tendency of people to form social network ties to those who are similar to themselves (25, 26).<br><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115</a></li><li id="tree-S8757580446"><strong>S8757580446:</strong> Social media algorithms exacerbate political polarization by favoring divisive content and misinformation, reinforcing confirmation bias and groupthink among users.<ul><li id="tree-E9938062031"><strong>E9938062031:</strong> Meanwhile, federal prosecutors pursuing more than 600 criminal cases are relying on evidence gathered from social media accounts used to organize the attempt by Trump supporters to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s victory.

How the polarizing effect of social media is speeding up In his new book, journalist Max Fisher unpacks how social media companies have engineered our feeds to keep us angry, and keep us online. Spending more time on social media will make you significantly more polarized, it will make you have a much sharper view of people in the other party, or maybe people who just support another figure within the political party that you support, it will make you have harsher views towards outgroups generally, and it will make you more prone to internally feeling in your in your own self outrage and moral outrage. But in fact, what you were seeing, and what you were experiencing, are choices made by these incredibly sophisticated automated systems that are designed to figure out exactly what combination of posts, what way to sequence those posts, how to present them to you will most engage certain very specific cognitive triggers and cognitive weak points that are meant to get certain emotions going. In his new book, The Chaos Machine, Fisher details how the polarizing effect of social media is speeding up.<br><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121295499/facebook-twitter-youtube-instagram-tiktok-social-media" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121295499/facebook-twitter-youtube-instagram-tiktok-social-media</a></li><li id="tree-E9090671465"><strong>E9090671465:</strong> Two new studies say there&#x27;s no evidence of political learning on social media, but it does increasingly teach us to hate our opponents. In his new article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he argues that digital media are driving affective polarization by enhancing the process of partisan sorting. Affective polarization is defined as the difference between positive in-group bias toward the party someone supports and negative out-group bias toward other parties. "Social conflict is sustainable as long as there are multiple and non-overlapping lines of disagreement: we may differ on our views on one issue but agree on another; we may vote differently, but if we support the same football team or go to the same church, there remains space for interpersonal respect," writes Törnberg. "The recent rise in polarization is thus expressive of a gradual breakdown of this cohesive glue, driven by a gradual alignment of social, economic, geographic, and ideological differences and conflicts." The paradoxical conclusion of his analysis is it "suggests that attempts of media platforms to reduce polarization by acting against echo chambers—algorithmically increasing exposure to opposing ideas—may backfire, instead resulting in intensified polarization and conflict." "By connecting individuals with others from outside their local social bubbles, digital media pressure local political cultures to align globally," he argues. "Over time, the system comes to sort on the global scale, with a single political culture becoming system-wide." That single political culture polarizes into two mutually hostile tribes.<br><a href="https://reason.com/2022/10/14/social-media-interaction-does-not-improve-political-knowledge-but-does-polarize-us/" target="_blank">https://reason.com/2022/10/14/social-media-interaction-does-not-improve-political-knowledge-but-does-polarize-us/</a></li><li id="tree-E7868403988"><strong>E7868403988:</strong> In his new article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, he argues that digital media are driving affective polarization by enhancing the process of partisan sorting.

Clearly, Facebook and its social media peers need to move beyond denial and come to grips with their role in heightening polarization. One place the industry could start is to make temperature-reducing algorithmic adjustments more permanent, rather than temporary. In doing so, tech platforms will have to continually refine their automated systems and content moderation policies to guard against the removal of legitimate political expression—admittedly a difficult challenge but one they brought upon themselves by building such vast, pervasive networks.

Polarization is widely recognized as one of the most pressing issues now facing the United States. Stories about how the country has fractured along partisan lines, and how the internet and social media exacerbate those cleavages, are frequently in the news. Americans dislike their political adversaries more than they used to. Meanwhile, disinformation and hate speech, often produced by actors with strong incentives to inflame existing social and political divisions, proliferate in digital spaces. The real-world consequences are far from trivial—consider the violence at the Capitol on January 6 or even the more recent assault on Nancy Pelosi’s husband. Although the extent to which political polarization leads individuals to violate democratic norms is a matter of debate, it is hard to imagine an event like the Capitol riot occurring absent such a polarized political climate. Of particular concern is affective polarization, which refers to the animus individuals feel toward those who disagree with them politically. If the free exchange of ideas between non-likeminded people is a basic tenet of democracy, then affective polarization threatens to undermine democracy itself. In the United States, affective polarization now underlies partisan standoffs over everything from COVID-19 policy to climate change. For social networks and digital platforms, polarization is both a challenge and opportunity. Social media companies are often blamed for driving greater polarization by virtue of the way they segment political audiences and personalize recommendations in line with their users’ existing beliefs and preferences. Given their scale and reach, however, they are also uniquely positioned to help reduce polarization.<br><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-social-media-platforms-can-reduce-polarization/" target="_blank">https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-social-media-platforms-can-reduce-polarization/</a></li><li id="tree-S6604865816"><strong>S6604865816:</strong> Social media platforms contribute to political polarization by amplifying partisan animosity and facilitating echo chambers, which reinforce in-group biases and out-group hostility.<ul><li id="tree-E7882345956"><strong>E7882345956:</strong> Widespread use of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media has fueled the fire of extreme polarization, Paul Barrett, Justin Hendrix, and Grant Sims write.

Although limited in scope, our findings may be of interest to those who are working to reduce political polarization in applied settings. More specifically, our study indicates that attempts to introduce people to a broad range of opposing political views on a social media site such as Twitter might be not only be ineffective but counterproductive—particularly if such interventions are initiated by liberals. We ran separate field experiments for Democratic and Republican respondents, and, within each group, we used a block randomization design that further stratified respondents according to two variables that have been linked to political polarization: (i) level of attachment to political party and (ii) level of interest in current events. We also randomized assignment according to respondents’ frequency of Twitter use, which we reasoned would influence the amount of exposure to the intervention we describe in the following paragraph and thereby the overall likelihood of opinion change. It is also unclear how exposure to opposing views might shape political polarization in other parts of the world. In addition, we did not study people who identify as independents, or those who use Twitter but do so infrequently. Such individuals might exhibit quite different reactions to an intervention such as ours. Finally, our intervention only exposed respondents to high-profile elites with opposing political ideologies. Although our liberal and conservative bots randomly selected messages from across the liberal and conservative spectrum, previous studies indicate such elites are significantly more polarized than the general electorate (45).<br><a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115" target="_blank">https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115</a></li><li id="tree-S6604865816"><strong>S6604865816:</strong> Social media platforms contribute to political polarization by amplifying partisan animosity and facilitating echo chambers, which reinforce in-group biases and out-group hostility.<ul><li id="tree-E7882345956"><strong>E7882345956:</strong> Widespread use of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other social media has fueled the fire of extreme polarization, Paul Barrett, Justin Hendrix, and Grant Sims write.

When used right, they can help to persuade and convert target audiences. For example: Social media marketers need to be mindful of biases and avoid the "I'm less biased than others" trap, aka bias blind spot. They need to learn how to mitigate their own biases when working on social media content strategies and plans. Cognitive biases serve to protect our brain against excessive fatigue, and that's the reason it stands against new information. Sure, we notice when something changes but, subconsciously, we don't like it. That's the reason why everything new triggers users like sin. Think of the constant storms of criticism that appear volcanically every time a website or an app updates its web design. A cognitive bias is a systematic and unconscious error in mental processing. It refers to the irrational nature of how we reason, predict, evaluate, and remember things in favor of our own perspectives despite the rational arguments at hand. The concept of cognitive bias was first introduced in 1976.<br><a href="https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/cognitive-biases-in-social-media" target="_blank">https://emplifi.io/resources/blog/cognitive-biases-in-social-media</a></li><li id="tree-E4057929460"><strong>E4057929460:</strong> Indeed, some cognitive biases work to marketers' advantage.

Media and social media amplify polarization through echo chambers and the spread of divisive content and misinformation.... These social groups could be based on religion, sexual orientation, race, or gender. This model has gained traction in modern politics because it helps explain the partisan stability seen in modern politics irrespective of short-term economic results or policy shifts. The drawbacks are obvious: erosion of democratic institutions and principles, increasing political polarization, legislative gridlock, confirmation bias, irrational policy-making, dehumanization of opponents, and so on. Furthermore, political tensions can amplify harassment and bullying – especially online where the illusion of anonymity emboldens otherwise reticent critics. Social media algorithms exacerbate this by spreading divisive content and misinformation as well as creating echo chambers. This reinforces groupthink and preconceived biases among voters. Clinical Relevance: Political polarization exacerbates social divisions and erodes trust in democratic institutions. It can also threaten mental health, causing stress and sleep loss. Social Identity Theory explains in-group cohesion and out-group discrimination, contributing to an “us vs. them” mindset. Media and social media amplify polarization through echo chambers and the spread of divisive content and misinformation. Group-level psychological processes relate to the Social Identity Theory of partisan politics. Therefore, it supports the belief that group identity, intergroup dynamics, and group norms play a larger role in political and ideological stance than individual belief. None of these theories are objectively wrong. Neither are they right. The political spectrum is significantly more nuanced than most politicians and media outlets would have voters believe. This sense of “false polarization” reduces inter-partisan cooperation and benefits political parties because it offers a stable voting base, distracts voters from crucial issues, and creates a political system based on simplified ideological heuristics instead of a nuanced approach that defines true policy-making.<br><a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/the-psychology-of-political-polarization/" target="_blank">https://www.psychiatrist.com/news/the-psychology-of-political-polarization/</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S2385993939" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S3909829070"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S3909829070</h3><ul><li id="tree-S3909829070"><strong>S3909829070:</strong> Developing tools that educate users about cognitive biases can enhance social media design, making users more resilient to manipulation and reducing political polarization.<ul><li id="tree-E7693398946"><strong>E7693398946:</strong> Researchers have developed tools to study the cognitive, societal and algorithmic biases that help fake news spread Researchers have developed tools to study the cognitive, societal and algorithmic biases that help fake news spread · By Giovanni Luca Ciampaglia, Filippo Menczer & The Conversation US ...

Social media are among the primary sources of news in the U.S. That is why our Observatory on Social Media at Indiana University is building tools to help people become aware of these biases and protect themselves from outside influences designed to exploit them. Cognitive biases originate in the way the brain processes the information that every person encounters every day. The third group of biases arises directly from the algorithms used to determine what people see online. Both social media platforms and search engines employ them. These personalization technologies are designed to select only the most engaging and relevant content for each individual user. But in doing so, it may end up reinforcing the cognitive and social biases of users, thus making them even more vulnerable to manipulation. Another important ingredient of social media is information that is trending on the platform, according to what is getting the most clicks. We call this popularity bias, because we have found that an algorithm designed to promote popular content may negatively affect the overall quality of information on the platform. This also feeds into existing cognitive bias, reinforcing what appears to be popular irrespective of its quality.<br><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biases-make-people-vulnerable-to-misinformation-spread-by-social-media/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/biases-make-people-vulnerable-to-misinformation-spread-by-social-media/</a></li><li id="tree-E4983337077"><strong>E4983337077:</strong> That is why our Observatory on Social Media at Indiana University is building tools to help people become aware of these biases and protect themselves from outside influences designed to exploit them.

Spending more time on social media will make you significantly more polarized, it will make you have a much sharper view of people in the other party, or maybe people who just support another figure within the political party that you support, it will make you have harsher views towards outgroups generally, and it will make you more prone to internally feeling in your in your own self outrage and moral outrage.<br><a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121295499/facebook-twitter-youtube-instagram-tiktok-social-media" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/2022/09/09/1121295499/facebook-twitter-youtube-instagram-tiktok-social-media</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S0616207649" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S3807663437"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S3807663437</h3><ul><li id="tree-S3807663437"><strong>S3807663437:</strong> Educational programs that increase awareness of cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias and belief perseverance, can effectively combat cognitive biases in political discourse among students.<ul><li id="tree-E2821631701"><strong>E2821631701:</strong> Learn about five common cognitive biases that can affect students. Includes classroom activities to help counter each bias. The Dunning-Kruger effect describes the tendency for people with limited knowledge in a particular area to be overconfident in their abilities. Novice drivers, for example, sometimes vastly overestimate their abilities, not aware of their potentially dangerous maneuvers. In an educational environment, this bias can prompt students to erroneously believe they’ve mastered a topic when they, in fact, have only a cursory knowledge of it. Let’s take a look at some of the most common cognitive biases that affect learning, and how you can give students the tools to counter them. ... Confirmation bias describes the tendency to seek out and give more weight to information or opinions that align with our existing beliefs. This common bias can partly explain the polarization of media consumption along political lines. Belief perseverance, the stubborn cousin of confirmation bias, refers to our inclination to cling to a conclusion even when faced with contradicting evidence. In an educational setting, this can hamper students’ receptiveness to new information on a topic and their ability to take constructive feedback from teachers or peers. Chances are you’ve observed the Google effect yourself, especially if you didn’t always have a smartphone in your pocket.

Like all humans, health professionals are subject to cognitive biases that can render diagnoses and treatment decisions vulnerable to error. Learning effective debiasing strategies and cultivating awareness of confirmation, anchoring, and outcomes biases and the affect heuristic, among others, and their effects on clinical decision making should be prioritized in all stages of education.

The importance of cognitive errors in diagnosis and strategies to minimize them. Cognitive biases contribute significantly to diagnostic and treatment errors.1,2 A 2016 review of their roles in decision making lists 4 domains of concern for physicians: gathering and interpreting evidence, taking action, and evaluating decisions.3 Although experts have identified many different types of cognitive biases, specific examples from these domains include confirmation bias, anchoring bias, the affect heuristic, and outcomes bias. In this article, we first discuss these biases, how they affect medical decision making, and how cognitive psychology helps to inform effective debiasing strategies. We then discuss specific debiasing strategies and how to integrate them into education. Simply increasing physicians’ familiarity with the many types of cognitive biases—and how to avoid them—may be one of the best strategies to decrease bias-related errors.1 Thus, education for medical students, residents, and fellows could fruitfully invest in training on cognitive biases, the role they play in diagnostic and treatment errors, and effective debiasing strategies.<br><a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/believing-overcoming-cognitive-biases/2020-09" target="_blank">https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/believing-overcoming-cognitive-biases/2020-09</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S3807663437" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S1934319128"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S1934319128</h3><ul><li id="tree-S1934319128"><strong>S1934319128:</strong> Cognitive bias modification training, including educational videos and debiasing games, can effectively reduce cognitive biases in political discourse.<ul><li id="tree-E6662957848"><strong>E6662957848:</strong> Research suggests that cognitive training can help minimize cognitive biases in thinking.

Training has also shown to reduce cognitive bias. Carey K. Morewedge and colleagues (2015) found that research participants exposed to one-shot training interventions, such as educational videos and debiasing games that taught mitigating strategies, exhibited significant reductions in their commission of six cognitive biases immediately and up to 3 months later. Critics of Kahneman and Tversky, such as Gerd Gigerenzer, alternatively argued that heuristics should not lead us to conceive of human thinking as riddled with irrational cognitive biases. They should rather conceive rationality as an adaptive tool, not identical to the rules of formal logic or the probability calculus. Nevertheless, experiments such as the "Linda problem" grew into heuristics and biases research programs, which spread beyond academic psychology into other disciplines including medicine and political science. A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment. Individuals create their own "subjective reality" from their perception of the input. An individual's construction of reality, not the objective input, may dictate their behavior in the world. While cognitive biases may initially appear to be negative, some are adaptive. They may lead to more effective actions in a given context. Furthermore, allowing cognitive biases enables faster decisions which can be desirable when timeliness is more valuable than accuracy, as illustrated in heuristics. Other cognitive biases are a "by-product" of human processing limitations, resulting from a lack of appropriate mental mechanisms (bounded rationality), the impact of an individual's constitution and biological state (see embodied cognition), or simply from a limited capacity for information processing.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias</a></li><li id="tree-E0571676780"><strong>E0571676780:</strong> Scientists regularly remind us of the many ways cognitive biases interfere with the choices we make: the general conclusion of the field has been that decision making cannot be improved within persons. Our latest field study suggests that this could be untrue. Cognitive bias has practical ramifications beyond private life, extending to professional domains including business, military operations, political policy, and medicine. Some of the clearest examples of the effects of bias on consequential decisions feature the influence of confirmation bias on military operations. As American author and educator Ben Yagoda pointed out in his compelling article in The Atlantic last year, without confirmation bias, the US may not have believed Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and decided to invade Iraq in 2003.
