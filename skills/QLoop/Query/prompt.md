## Process

### STEP 1: Progress Assessment

Carefully analyze the previous queries, statements, and the most recent analysis. Determine whether the research is making meaningful progress or if it appears to be stagnating. Consider:

1. Are recent queries yielding substantially new information?
2. Is the research converging towards answering the main question, or is it circling around similar points?
3. Have we exhausted the current line of inquiry?
4. Does the previous analysis highlight any under-explored areas or suggest new directions?
5. Are there any contradictions or gaps in our current understanding that need to be addressed?

Provide a brief assessment of the research progress, taking into account both the previous queries/statements and the latest analysis.

### STEP 2: Strategy Formulation

Based on your progress assessment, decide on the best strategy for the next set of queries. If progress is satisfactory, focus on deepening the current line of inquiry. If progress has stalled, consider using one of the following strategies to get unstuck:

#### Strategies for Getting Unstuck

- Zoom out: Broaden the scope to explore larger themes or systems that encompass the current focus.
- Zoom in: Narrow the focus to examine specific sub-components or case studies.
- Change perspective: Approach the topic from the viewpoint of different stakeholders or disciplines.
- Explore analogies: Look for similar phenomena in other fields that might provide fresh insights.
- Examine opposites: Consider the inverse of the current focus to gain new perspectives.
- Temporal shift: Look at historical precedents or future projections of the issue.
- Cause and effect: Investigate upstream causes or downstream effects of the current focus.
- Interdisciplinary approach: Incorporate insights from adjacent or seemingly unrelated fields.
- Reframe the problem: Rephrase the question in a fundamentally different way.
- Explore edge cases: Look at extreme scenarios or outliers related to the topic.

Briefly explain your chosen strategy and how it will address the current state of the research.

### STEP 3: Query Generation

Generate {{$NUM_QUERIES}} new queries that align with your chosen strategy. These queries should:

1. All target the same search intent, derived from your chosen strategy and the current state of research.
2. Be directly relevant to the main research question.
3. Avoid redundancy with previous queries.
4. Be concise and suitable for a Google-like search engine (aim for 5-15 words each).
5. If progress has stalled, approach the problem from novel angles or draw from analogous fields.
6. Use maximally diverse phrasing and keywords across the queries to ensure the widest possible range of search results.
7. Use natural language phrasing that a human might type into a search engine.
8. Avoid using special search operators, quotation marks, or Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT).

When formulating your queries, focus on maximizing linguistic diversity:

- Use a wide range of synonyms for key concepts, ensuring each query uses different terms where possible.
- Vary sentence structures dramatically: use questions, statements, and imperatives.
- Frame the core idea from multiple perspectives or within different contexts.
- Alternate between technical terminology and layman's terms.
- Incorporate interdisciplinary language to capture content from various fields.
- Use both formal and colloquial language styles.
- Consider cultural and regional linguistic variations if applicable.

Present your queries in a JSON array with exactly{{$NUM_QUERIES}} elements. Provide a brief explanation of how this set of queries will drive the research forward, either by deepening our current understanding or by exploring new, potentially fruitful directions. Also, explain how your varied phrasings and keyword choices are designed to encourage the most diverse search results possible.

Remember, the goal is to generate a set of queries that will yield new, relevant information to advance our understanding of the main research question. If you find that the research is stuck in a particular area, don't hesitate to pivot and explore other aspects of the problem.

## Examples

Note: The following examples show 5 queries each, but you should generate exactly {{$NUM_QUERIES}} queries.

### Example 1: Climate Change Economics

Main Question: "What are the most effective economic policies to mitigate climate change while ensuring global economic stability?"

Previous Queries:
1. How effective are carbon taxes in reducing emissions
2. Impact of green technology investments on job markets
3. Compare cap and trade systems with carbon taxes

Progress Assessment: The research has focused primarily on carbon pricing mechanisms and green technology investments. While these are crucial aspects, we've reached a point of diminishing returns in these specific areas.

Strategy: Pivot to explore the intersection of climate policies with international trade and development economics.

Queries:
1. How do green policies affect industrial growth in developing nations
2. Global commerce agreements impact on greenhouse gas reduction
3. Balancing economic expansion and environmental protection in emerging markets
4. Low emission industrialization tactics for Global South countries
5. International eco-finance schemes supporting sustainable progress in poor regions

Explanation: This set of queries explores the intersection of climate policies, international trade, and development economics with maximum linguistic diversity. Each query uses different synonyms and phrasings for key concepts: "green policies" vs. "environmental protection," "industrial growth" vs. "economic expansion," "developing nations" vs. "Global South countries" vs. "poor regions." The queries also vary in structure, from questions to noun phrases to gerund forms. This diversity in language and structure aims to capture a wide range of relevant content, from academic papers to policy documents to news articles, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the topic from multiple angles and vocabularies.

### Example 2: AI and Society

Main Question: "How will advanced AI systems impact social structures and individual autonomy in the next decade?"

Previous Queries:
1. Predict AI influence on job markets between 2025 and 2035
2. Ethical concerns in AI driven healthcare decision making
3. Effects of AI personalization on consumer choices

Progress Assessment: Our research has covered immediate economic and ethical concerns but hasn't adequately addressed broader societal structures or long-term autonomy issues.

Strategy: Reframe the question to focus on systemic changes and second-order effects of AI integration in society.

Queries:
1. How will smart algorithms reshape political processes
2. Impact of machine learning on socioeconomic stratification
3. Artificial intelligence effects on cultural identity formation
4. Long term consequences of computerized decision making on free will
5. Power dynamics shift from widespread adoption of thinking machines

Explanation: These queries maintain the same underlying intent but use highly diverse language to capture a wide range of relevant content. "AI systems" becomes "smart algorithms," "thinking machines," and "computerized decision making." "Social structures" is explored through "political processes," "socioeconomic stratification," and "power dynamics." "Individual autonomy" is rephrased as "cultural identity formation" and "free will." The queries also vary in structure and formality, from a direct question to more academic phrasing to a more colloquial framing. This linguistic diversity aims to retrieve content from various sources, from academic literature to policy documents to public discourse, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of AI's societal impact.
