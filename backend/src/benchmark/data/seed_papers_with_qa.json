Here we present MedSAM, a foundation model designed\nfor bridging this gap by enabling universal medical image segmentation. The\nmodel is developed on a large-scale medical image dataset with 1,570,263\nimage-mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities and over 30 cancer types.\nWe conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 86 internal validation tasks and 60\nexternal validation tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness than\nmodality-wise specialist models. By delivering accurate and efficient seg\u0002mentation across a wide spectrum of tasks, MedSAM holds significant\npotential to expedite the evolution of diagnostic tools and the personalization\nof treatment plans.\nSegmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging analysis, which\ninvolves identifying and delineating regions of interest (ROI) in various\nmedical images, such as organs, lesions, and tissues1\n. Accurate seg\u0002mentation is essential for many clinical applications, including disease\ndiagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of disease\nprogression2,3\n. Manual segmentation has long been the gold standard\nfor delineating anatomical structures and pathological regions, but\nthis process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often requires a\nhigh degree of expertise. Semi- or fully automatic segmentation\nmethods can significantly reduce the time and labor required, increase\nconsistency, and enable the analysis of large-scale datasets4\n.\nDeep learning-based models have shown great promise in medical\nimage segmentation due to their ability to learn intricate image fea\u0002tures and deliver accurate segmentation results across a diverse range\nof tasks, from segmenting specific anatomical structures to identifying\npathological regions5\n. However, a significant limitation of many cur\u0002rent medical image segmentation models is their task-specific nature.\nThese models are typically designed and trained for a specific seg\u0002mentation task, and their performance can degrade significantly when\napplied to new tasks or different types of imaging data6\n. This lack of\ngenerality poses a substantial obstacle to the wider application of\nthese models in clinical practice. In contrast, recent advances in the\nfield of natural image segmentation have witnessed the emergence of\nsegmentation foundation models, such as segment anything model\n(SAM)7 and Segment Everything Everywhere with Multi-modal\nprompts all at once8\n, showcasing remarkable versatility and perfor\u0002mance across various segmentation tasks.\nThere is a growing demand for universal models in medical image\nsegmentation: models that can be trained once and then applied to a\nwide range of segmentation tasks. Such models would not only exhibit\nheightened versatility in terms of model capacity but also potentially\nlead to more consistent results across different tasks. However, the\napplicability of the segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM7\n) to\nmedical image segmentation remains limited due to the significant\ndifferences between natural images and medical images. Essentially,\nSAM is a promptable segmentation method that requires points or\nbounding boxes to specify the segmentation targets. This resembles\nconventional interactive segmentation methods4,9\u201311 but SAM has bet\u0002ter generalization ability, while existing deep learning-based inter\u0002active segmentation methods focus mainly on limited tasks and image\nmodalities.\nMany studies have applied the out-of-the-box SAM models to\ntypical medical image segmentation tasks12\u201317 and other challenging\nscenarios18\u201321. For example, the concurrent studies22,23 conducted a\nReceived: 24 October 2023\nAccepted: 5 January 2024\nCheck for updates\n1\nPeter Munk Cardiac Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada. 2Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto,\nToronto, ON, Canada. 3\nVector Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada. 4Department of Computer Science, Western University, London, ON, Canada. 5Tandon School\nof Engineering, New York University, New York, NY, USA. 6\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA. 7Department of\nComputer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada. 8\nUHN AI Hub, Toronto, ON, Canada. e-mail: bowang@vectorinstitute.ai\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 1\n1234567890():,;1234567890():,;\ncomprehensive assessment of SAM across a diverse array of medical\nimages, underscoring that SAM achieved satisfactory segmentation\noutcomes primarily on targets characterized by distinct boundaries.\nHowever, the model exhibited substantial limitations in segmenting\ntypical medical targets with weak boundaries or low contrast. In con\u0002gruence with these observations, we further introduce MedSAM, a\nrefined foundation model that significantly enhances the segmenta\u0002tion performance of SAM on medical images. MedSAM accomplishes\nthis by fine-tuning SAM on an unprecedented dataset with more than\none million medical image-mask pairs.\nWe thoroughly evaluate MedSAM through comprehensive\nexperiments on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation\ntasks, spanning a variety of anatomical structures, pathological con\u0002ditions, and medical imaging modalities. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MedSAM consistently outperforms the state-of-the\u0002art (SOTA) segmentation foundation model7\n, while achieving perfor\u0002mance on par with, or even surpassing specialist models1,24 that were\ntrained on the images from the same modality. These results highlight\nthe potential of MedSAM as a new paradigm for versatile medical\nimage segmentation.\nResults\nMedSAM: a foundation model for promptable medical image\nsegmentation\nMedSAM aims to fulfill the role of a foundation model for universal\nmedical image segmentation. A crucial aspect of constructing such a\nmodel is the capacity to accommodate a wide range of variations in\nimaging conditions, anatomical structures, and pathological condi\u0002tions. To address this challenge, we curated a diverse and large-scale\nmedical image segmentation dataset with 1,570,263 medical image\u0002mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities, over 30 cancer types, and\na multitude of imaging protocols (Fig. 1 and Supplementary\nTables 1\u20134). This large-scale dataset allows MedSAM to learn a rich\nrepresentation of medical images, capturing a broad spectrum of\nanatomies and lesions across different modalities. Figure 2a provides\nan overview of the distribution of images across different medical\nimaging modalities in the dataset, ranked by their total numbers. It is\nevident that computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance ima\u0002ging (MRI), and endoscopy are the dominant modalities, reflecting\ntheir ubiquity in clinical practice. CT and MRI images provide detailed\ncross-sectional views of 3D body structures, making them indis\u0002pensable for non-invasive diagnostic imaging. Endoscopy, albeit more\ninvasive, enables direct visual inspection of organ interiors, proving\ninvaluable for diagnosing gastrointestinal and urological conditions.\nDespite the prevalence of these modalities, others such as ultrasound,\npathology, fundus, dermoscopy, mammography, and optical coher\u0002ence tomography (OCT) also hold significant roles in clinical practice.\nThe diversity of these modalities and their corresponding segmenta\u0002tion targets underscores the necessity for universal and effective\nsegmentation models capable of handling the unique characteristics\nassociated with each modality.\nAnother critical consideration is the selection of the appropriate\nsegmentation prompt and network architecture. While the concept of\nfully automatic segmentation foundation models is enticing, it is\nfraught with challenges that make it impractical. One of the primary\nchallenges is the variability inherent in segmentation tasks. For\nexample, given a liver cancer CT image, the segmentation task can vary\ndepending on the specific clinical scenario. One clinician might be\nFig. 1 | MedSAM is trained on a large-scale dataset that can handle diverse segmentation tasks. The dataset covers a variety of anatomical structures, pathological\nconditions, and medical imaging modalities. The magenta contours and mask overlays denote the expert annotations and MedSAM segmentation results, respectively.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 2\ninterested in segmenting the liver tumor, while another might need to\nsegment the entire liver and surrounding organs. Additionally, the\nvariability in imaging modalities presents another challenge. Mod\u0002alities such as CT and MR generate 3D images, whereas others like\nX-ray and ultrasound yield 2D images. These variabilities in task defi\u0002nition and imaging modalities complicate the design of a fully auto\u0002matic model capable of accurately anticipating and addressing the\ndiverse requirements of different users.\nConsidering these challenges, we argue that a more practical\napproach is to develop a promptable 2D segmentation model. The\nmodel can be easily adapted to specific tasks based on user-provided\nprompts, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability. It is also able\nto handle both 2D and 3D images by processing 3D images as a series\nof 2D slices. Typical user prompts include points and bounding boxes\nand we show some segmentation examples with the different prompts\nin Supplementary Fig. 1. It can be found that bounding boxes provide a\nmore unambiguous spatial context for the region of interest, enabling\nthe algorithm to more precisely discern the target area. This stands in\ncontrast to point-based prompts, which can introduce ambiguity,\nparticularly when proximate structures resemble each other. More\u0002over, drawing a bounding box is efficient, especially in scenarios\ninvolving multi-object segmentation. We follow the network archi\u0002tecture in SAM7\n, including an image encoder, a prompt encoder, and a\nmask decoder (Fig. 2b). The image encoder25 maps the input image\ninto a high-dimensional image embedding space. The prompt encoder\ntransforms the user-drawn bounding boxes into feature representa\u0002tions via positional encoding26. Finally, the mask decoder fuses the\nimage embedding and prompt features using cross-attention27\n(Methods).\nQuantitative and qualitative analysis\nWe evaluated MedSAM through both internal validation and external\nvalidation. Specifically, we compared it to the SOTA segmentation\nfoundation model SAM7 as well as modality-wise specialist U-Net1 and\nDeepLabV3+24 models. Each specialized model was trained on images\nfrom the corresponding modality, resulting in 10 dedicated specialist\nmodels for each method. During inference, these specialist models\nwere used to segment the images from corresponding modalities,\nwhile SAM and MedSAM were employed for segmenting images across\nall modalities (Methods). The internal validation contained 86 seg\u0002mentation tasks (Supplementary Tables 5\u20138 and Fig. 2), and Fig. 3a\nshows the median dice similarity coefficient (DSC) score of these tasks\nfor the four methods. Overall, SAM obtained the lowest performance\non most segmentation tasks although it performed promisingly on\nsome RGB image segmentation tasks, such as polyp (DSC: 91.3%,\ninterquartile range (IQR): 81.2\u201395.1%) segmentation in endoscopy\nimages. This could be attributed to SAM\u2019s training on a variety of RGB\nimages, and the fact that many targets in these images are relatively\nstraightforward to segment due to their distinct appearances. The\nother three models outperformed SAM by a large margin and MedSAM\nhas a narrower distribution of DSC scores of the 86 interval validation\ntasks than the two groups of specialist models, reflecting the robust\u0002ness of MedSAM across different tasks. We further connected the DSC\nscores corresponding to the same task of the four models with the\npodium plot Fig. 3b, which is complementary to the box plot. In the\nupper part, each colored dot denotes the median DSC achieved with\nthe respective method on one task. Dots corresponding to identical\ntest cases are connected by a line. In the lower part, the frequency of\nachieved ranks for each method is presented with bar charts. It can be\nfound that MedSAM ranked in first place on most tasks, surpassing the\nperformance of the U-Net and DeepLabV3+ specialist models that have\na high frequency of ranks with second and third places, respectively, In\ncontrast, SAM ranked last place in almost all tasks. Figure 3c (and\nSupplementary Fig. 9) visualizes some randomly selected segmenta\u0002tion examples where MedSAM obtained a median DSC score, including\nliver tumor in CT images, brain tumor in MR images, breast tumor in\nultrasound images, and polyp in endoscopy images. SAM struggles\nwith targets of weak boundaries, which is prone to under or over\u0002segmentation errors. In contrast, MedSAM can accurately segment a\nwide range of targets across various imaging conditions, which\nachieves comparable of even better than the specialist U-Net and\nDeepLabV3+ models.\nThe external validation included 60 segmentation tasks, all of\nwhich either were from new datasets or involved unseen segmen\u0002tation targets (Supplementary Tables 9\u201311 and Figs. 10\u201312). Fig\u0002ure 4a, b show the task-wise median DSC score distribution and their\ncorrespondence of the 60 tasks, respectively. Although SAM con\u0002tinued exhibiting lower performance on most CT and MR segmen\u0002tation tasks, the specialist models no longer consistently\noutperformed SAM (e.g., right kidney segmentation in MR T1-\nweighted images: 90.1%, 85.3%, 86.4% for SAM, U-Net, and Dee\u0002pLabV3+, respectively). This indicates the limited generalization\nability of such specialist models on unseen targets. In contrast,\nMedSAM consistently delivers superior performance. For example,\nMedSAM obtained median DSC scores of 87.8% (IQR: 85.0-91.4%) on\nthe nasopharynx cancer segmentation task, demonstrating 52.3%,\n15.5%, and 22.7 improvements over SAM, the specialist U-Net, and\nDeepLabV3+, respectively. Significantly, MedSAM also achieved\nbetter performance in some unseen modalities (e.g., abdomen T1\nInphase and Outphase), surpassing SAM and the specialist models\nwith improvements by up to 10%. Figure 4c presents four randomly\nselected segmentation examples for qualitative evaluation, reveal\u0002ing that while all the methods have the ability to handle simple\nsegmentation targets, MedSAM performs better at segmenting\nchallenging targets with indistinguishable boundaries, such as cer\u0002vical cancer in MR images (more examples are presented in Sup\u0002plementary Fig. 13). Furthermore, we evaluated MedSAM on the\nmultiple myeloma plasma cell dataset, which represents a distinct\nmodality and task in contrast to all previously leveraged validation\ntasks. Although this task had never been seen during training,\na b\nImage\nencoder\nBounding box prompts\nMask decoder\nPrompt encoder\nInput Image Segmentation\nImage\nembedding\nFig. 2 | Overview of the modality distribution in the dataset and the network architecture. a The number of medical image-mask pairs in each modality. b MedSAM is a\npromptable segmentation method where users can use bounding boxes to specify the segmentation targets.

We additionally trained MedSAM on\ntwo different dataset sizes: 10,000 (10K) and 100,000 (100K) images\nand their performances were compared with the default MedSAM\nmodel. The 10K and 100K training images were uniformly sampled\nfrom the whole training set, to maintain data diversity. As shown in\n(Fig. 5a) (Supplementary Tables 12\u201314), the performance adhered to\nthe scaling rule, where increasing the number of training images sig\u0002nificantly improved the performance in both internal and external\nvalidation sets.\nMedSAM can improve the annotation efficiency\nFurthermore, we conducted a human annotation study to assess the\ntime cost of two pipelines (Methods). For the first pipeline, two human\nexperts manually annotate 3D adrenal tumors in a slice-by-slice way. For\nthe second pipeline, the experts first drew the long and short tumor axes\nwith the linear marker (initial marker) every 3-10 slices, which is a com\u0002mon practice in tumor response evaluation. Then, MedSAM was used to\nsegment the tumors based on these sparse linear annotations. Finally,\nthe expert manually revised the segmentation results until they were\nsatisfied. We quantitatively compared the annotation time cost between\nthe two pipelines (Fig. 5b). The results demonstrate that with the assis\u0002tance of MedSAM, the annotation time is substantially reduced by\n82.37% and 82.95% for the two experts, respectively.\nDiscussion\nWe introduce MedSAM, a deep learning-powered foundation model\ndesigned for the segmentation of a wide array of anatomical structures\nand lesions across diverse medical imaging modalities. MedSAM is\ntrained on a meticulously assembled large-scale dataset comprised of\nover one million medical image-mask pairs. Its promptable config\u0002uration strikes an optimal balance between automation and customi\u0002zation, rendering MedSAM a versatile tool for universal medical image\nsegmentation.\nThrough comprehensive evaluations encompassing both internal\nand external validation, MedSAM has demonstrated substantial cap\u0002abilities in segmenting a diverse array of targets and robust general\u0002ization abilities to manage new data and tasks. Its performance not\nonly significantly exceeds that of existing the state-of-the-art seg\u0002mentation foundation model, but also rivals or even surpasses spe\u0002cialist models. By providing precise delineation of anatomical\nstructures and pathological regions, MedSAM facilitates the compu\u0002tation of various quantitative measures that serve as biomarkers. For\ninstance, in the field of oncology, MedSAM could play a crucial role in\naccelerating the 3D tumor annotation process, enabling subsequent\ncalculations of tumor volume, which is a critical biomarker29 for\nassessing disease progression and response to treatment. Additionally,\nMedSAM provides a successful paradigm for adapting natural image\nfoundation models to new domains, which can be further extended to\nbiological image segmentation30, such as cell segmentation in light\nmicroscopy images31 and organelle segmentation in electron micro\u0002scopy images32.\nWhile MedSAM boasts strong capabilities, it does present certain\nlimitations. One such limitation is the modality imbalance in the\ntraining set, with CT, MRI, and endoscopy images dominating the\ndataset. This could potentially impact the model\u2019s performance on\nless-represented modalities, such as mammography. Another limita\u0002tion is its difficulty in the segmentation of vessel-like branching\nstructures because the bounding box prompt can be ambiguous in this\nsetting. For example, arteries and veins share the same bounding box\nin eye fundus images. However, these limitations do not diminish\nMedSAM\u2019s utility. Since MedSAM has learned rich and representative\nmedical image features from the large-scale training set, it can be fine\u0002tuned to effectively segment new tasks from less-represented mod\u0002alities or intricate structures like vessels.\nIn conclusion, this study highlights the feasibility of constructing a\nsingle foundation model capable of managing a multitude of seg\u0002mentation tasks, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific models.\nMedSAM, as the inaugural foundation model in medical image seg\u0002mentation, holds great potential to accelerate the advancement of new\ndiagnostic and therapeutic tools, and ultimately contribute to\nimproved patient care33.\nMethods\nDataset curation and pre-processing\nWe curated a comprehensive dataset by collating images from publicly\navailable medical image segmentation datasets, which were obtained\nfrom various sources across the internet, including the Cancer Imaging\nArchive (TCIA)34, Kaggle, Grand-Challenge, Scientific Data, CodaLab,\nand segmentation challenges in the Medical Image Computing and\nComputer Assisted Intervention Society (MICCAI). All the datasets\nprovided segmentation annotations by human experts, which have\nbeen widely used in existing literature (Supplementary Table 1\u20134). We\nincorporated these annotations directly for both model development\nand validation.\nThe original 3D datasets consisted of computed tomography (CT)\nand magnetic resonance (MR) images in DICOM, nrrd, or mhd formats.\nTo ensure uniformity and compatibility with developing medical\nimage deep learning models, we converted the images to the widely\nused NifTI format. Additionally, grayscale images (such as X-Ray and\nUltrasound) as well as RGB images (including endoscopy, dermoscopy,\nfundus, and pathology images), were converted to the png format.\nFig. 5 | The effect of training dataset size and a user study of tumor annotation\nefficiency. a Scaling up the training image size to one million can significantly\nimprove the model performance on both internal and external validation sets.\nb MedSAM can be used to substantially reduce the annotation time cost. Source\ndata are provided as a Source Data file.\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 5\nSeveral exclusive criteria are applied to improve the dataset quality\nand consistency, including incomplete images and segmentation tar\u0002gets with branching structures, inaccurate annotations, and tiny\nvolumes. Notably, image intensities varied significantly across differ\u0002ent modalities. For instance, CT images had intensity values ranging\nfrom -2000 to 2000, while MR images exhibited a range of 0 to 3000.\nIn endoscopy and ultrasound images, intensity values typically span\u0002ned from 0 to 255. To facilitate stable training, we performed intensity\nnormalization across all images, ensuring they shared the same\nintensity range.\nFor CT images, we initially normalized the Hounsfield units using\ntypical window width and level values. The employed window width\nand level values for soft tissues, lung, and brain are (W:400, L:40),\n(W:1500, L:-160), and (W:80, L:40), respectively. Subsequently, the\nintensity values were rescaled to the range of [0, 255]. For MR, X-ray,\nultrasound, mammography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT)\nimages, we clipped the intensity values to the range between the 0.5th\nand 99.5th percentiles before rescaling them to the range of [0, 255].\nRegarding RGB images (e.g., endoscopy, dermoscopy, fundus, and\npathology images), if they were already within the expected intensity\nrange of [0, 255], their intensities remained unchanged. However, if\nthey fell outside this range, we utilized max-min normalization to\nrescale the intensity values to [0, 255]. Finally, to meet the model\u2019s\ninput requirements, all images were resized to a uniform size of\n1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3. In the case of whole-slide pathology images, patches\nwere extracted using a sliding window approach without overlaps. The\npatches located on boundaries were padded to this size with 0. As for\n3D CT and MR images, each 2D slice was resized to 1024 \u00d7 1024, and\nthe channel was repeated three times to maintain consistency. The\nremaining 2D images were directly resized to 1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3. Bi-cubic\ninterpolation was used for resizing images, while nearest-neighbor\ninterpolation was applied for resizing masks to preserve their precise\nboundaries and avoid introducing unwanted artifacts. These standar\u0002dization procedures ensured uniformity and compatibility across all\nimages and facilitated seamless integration into the subsequent stages\nof the model training and evaluation pipeline.\nNetwork architecture\nThe network utilized in this study was built on transformer\narchitecture27, which has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in\nvarious domains such as natural language processing and image\nrecognition tasks25. Specifically, the network incorporated a vision\ntransformer (ViT)-based image encoder responsible for extracting\nimage features, a prompt encoder for integrating user interactions\n(bounding boxes), and a mask decoder that generated segmentation\nresults and confidence scores using the image embedding, prompt\nembedding, and output token.\nTo strike a balance between segmentation performance and com\u0002putational efficiency, we employed the base ViT model as the image\nencoder since extensive evaluation indicated that larger ViT models,\nsuch as ViT Large and ViT Huge, offered only marginal improvements in\naccuracy7 while significantly increasing computational demands. Speci\u0002fically, the base ViT model consists of 12 transformer layers27, with each\nblock comprising a multi-head self-attention block and a Multilayer\nPerceptron (MLP) block incorporating layer normalization35. Pre-training\nwas performed using masked auto-encoder modeling36, followed by\nfully supervised training on the SAM dataset7\n. The input image\n(1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3) was reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D patches\nwith the size 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 3, yielding a feature size in image embedding of\n64 \u00d7 64 after passing through the image encoder, which is 16 \u00d7 down\u0002scaled. The prompt encoders mapped the corner point of the bounding\nbox prompt to 256-dimensional vectorial embeddings26. In particular,\neach bounding box was represented by an embedding pair of the top\u0002left corner point and the bottom-right corner point. To facilitate real\u0002time user interactions once the image embedding had been computed, a\nlightweight mask decoder architecture was employed. It consists of two\ntransformer layers27 for fusing the image embedding and prompt\nencoding, and two transposed convolutional layers to enhance the\nembedding resolution to 256 \u00d7 256. Subsequently, the embedding\nunderwent sigmoid activation, followed by bi-linear interpolations to\nmatch the input size.\nTraining protocol and experimental setting\nDuring data pre-processing, we obtained 1,570,263 medical image\u0002mask pairs for model development and validation. For internal vali\u0002dation, we randomly split the dataset into 80%, 10%, and 10% as\ntraining, tuning, and validation, respectively. Specifically, for mod\u0002alities where within-scan continuity exists, such as CT and MRI, and\nmodalities where continuity exists between consecutive frames, we\nperformed the data splitting at the 3D scan and the video level\nrespectively, by which any potential data leak was prevented. For\npathology images, recognizing the significance of slide-level cohe\u0002siveness, we first separated the whole-slide images into distinct slide\u0002based sets. Then, each slide was divided into small patches with a fixed\nsize of 1024 \u00d7 1024. This setup allowed us to monitor the model\u2019s\nperformance on the tuning set and adjust its parameters during\ntraining to prevent overfitting. For the external validation, all datasets\nwere held out and did not appear during model training. These data\u0002sets provide a stringent test of the model\u2019s generalization ability, as\nthey represent new patients, imaging conditions, and potentially new\nsegmentation tasks that the model has not encountered before. By\nevaluating the performance of MedSAM on these unseen datasets, we\ncan gain a realistic understanding of how MedSAM is likely to perform\nin real-world clinical settings, where it will need to handle a wide range\nof variability and unpredictability in the data. The training and vali\u0002dation are independent.\nThe model was initialized with the pre-trained SAM model with\nthe ViT-Base model. We fixed the prompt encoder since it can already\nencode the bounding box prompt. All the trainable parameters in the\nimage encoder and mask decoder were updated during training.\nSpecifically, the number of trainable parameters for the image encoder\nand mask decoder are 89,670,912 and 4,058,340, respectively. The\nbounding box prompt was simulated from the expert annotations with\na random perturbation of 0-20 pixels. The loss function is the\nunweighted sum between dice loss and cross-entropy loss, which has\nbeen proven to be robust in various segmentation tasks1\n. The network\nwas optimized by AdamW37 optimizer (\u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999) with an\ninitial learning rate of 1e-4 and a weight decay of 0.01. The global batch\nsize was 160 and data augmentation was not used. The model was\ntrained on 20 A100 (80G) GPUs with 150 epochs and the last check\u0002point was selected as the final model.\nFurthermore, to thoroughly evaluate the performance of Med\u0002SAM, we conducted comparative analyses against both the state-of\u0002the-art segmentation foundation model SAM7 and specialist models\n(i.e., U-Net1 and DeepLabV3+24). The training images contained 10\nmodalities: CT, MR, chest X-ray (CXR), dermoscopy, endoscopy,\nultrasound, mammography, OCT, and pathology, and we trained the\nU-Net and DeepLabV3+ specialist models for each modality. There\nwere 20 specialist models in total and the number of corresponding\ntraining images was presented in Supplementary Table 5. We\nemployed the nnU-Net to conduct all U-Net experiments, which can\nautomatically configure the network architecture based on the dataset\nproperties. In order to incorporate the bounding box prompt into the\nmodel, we transformed the bounding box into a binary mask and\nconcatenated it with the image as the model input. This function was\noriginally supported by nnU-Net in the cascaded pipeline, which has\ndemonstrated increased performance in many segmentation tasks by\nusing the binary mask as an additional channel to specify the target\nlocation. The training settings followed the default configurations of\n2D nnU-Net. Each model was trained on one A100 GPU with 1000\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 6\nepochs and the last checkpoint was used as the final model. The\nDeepLabV3+ specialist models used ResNet5038 as the encoder. Similar\nto ref. 3, the input images were resized to 224 \u00d7 224 \u00d7 3. The bounding\nbox was transformed into a binary mask as an additional input channel\nto provide the object location prompt. Segmentation Models Pytorch\n(0.3.3)39 was used to perform training and inference for all the\nmodality-wise specialist DeepLabV3 + models. Each modality-wise\nmodel was trained on one A100 GPU with 500 epochs and the last\ncheckpoint was used as the final model. During the inference phase,\nSAM and MedSAM were used to perform segmentation across all\nmodalities with a single model. In contrast, the U-Net and DeepLabV3+\nspecialist models were used to individually segment the respective\ncorresponding modalities.\nA task-specific segmentation model might outperform a modality\u0002based one for certain applications. Since U-Net obtained better per\u0002formance than DeepLabV3+ on most tasks, we further conducted a\ncomparison study by training task-specific U-Net models on four\nrepresentative tasks, including liver cancer segmentation in CT scans,\nabdominal organ segmentation in MR scans, nerve cancer segmenta\u0002tion in ultrasound, and polyp segmentation in endoscopy images. The\nexperiments included both internal validation and external validation.\nFor internal validation, we adhered to the default data splits, using\nthem to train the task-specific U-Net models and then evaluate their\nperformance on the corresponding validation set. For external vali\u0002dation, the trained U-Net models were evaluated on new datasets from\nthe same modality or segmentation targets. In all these experiments,\nMedSAM was directly applied to the validation sets without additional\nfine-tuning. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 15, while task-specific U\u0002Net models often achieved great results on internal validation sets,\ntheir performance diminished significantly for external sets. In con\u0002trast, MedSAM maintained consistent performance across both inter\u0002nal and external validation sets. This underscores MedSAM\u2019s superior\ngeneralization ability, making it a versatile tool in a variety of medical\nimage segmentation tasks.\nLoss function\nWe used the unweighted sum between cross-entropy loss and dice\nloss40 as the final loss function since it has been proven to be robust\nacross different medical image segmentation tasks41. Specifically, let\nS, G denote the segmentation result and ground truth, respectively.\nsi, gi denotes the predicted segmentation and ground truth of voxel i,\nrespectively. N is the number of voxels in the image I. Binary cross\u0002entropy loss is defined by\nLBCE = \u0001 1\nN\nXN\ni = 1\ngi log si + \u00f01 \u0001 gi\u00de log\u00f01 \u0001 si\u00de \u0002 \u0003, \u00f01\u00de\nand dice loss is defined by\nLDice = 1 \u0001 2\nPN\ni = 1 gisi PN\ni = 1 \u00f0gi\u00de\n2 + PN\ni = 1 \u00f0si\u00de\n2 : \u00f02\u00de\nThe final loss L is defined by\nL = LBCE + LDice: \u00f03\u00de\nHuman annotation study\nThe objective of the human annotation study was to quantitatively\nevaluate how MedSAM can reduce the annotation time cost. Specifi\u0002cally, we used the recent adrenocortical carcinoma CT dataset34,42,43,\nwhere the segmentation target, adrenal tumor, was neither part of the\ntraining nor of the existing validation sets. We randomly sampled 10\ncases, comprising a total of 733 tumor slices requiring annotations.\nTwo human experts participated in this study, both of whom are\nexperienced radiologists with 8 and 6 years of clinical practice in\nabdominal diseases, respectively. Each expert generated two groups of\nannotations, one with the assistance of MedSAM and one without.\nIn the first group, the experts manually annotated the 3D adrenal\ntumor in a slice-by-slice manner. Annotations by the two experts were\nconducted independently, with no collaborative discussions, and the\ntime taken for each case was recorded. In the second group, annota\u0002tions were generated after one week of cooling period. The experts\nindependently drew the long and short tumor axes as initial markers,\nwhich is a common practice in tumor response evaluation. This pro\u0002cess was executed every 3-10 slices from the top slice to the bottom\nslice of the tumor. Then, we applied MedSAM to segment the tumors\nbased on these sparse linear annotations, including three steps.\n\u2022 Step 1. For each annotated slice, a rectangle binary mask was\ngenerated based on the linear label that can completely cover\nthe linear label. \u2022 Step 2. For the unlabeled slices, the rectangle binary masks were\ncreated through interpolation of the surrounding labeled slices. \u2022 Step 3. We transformed the binary masks into bounding boxes\nand then fed them along with the images into MedSAM to gen\u0002erate segmentation results.\nAll these steps were conducted in an automatic way and the model\nrunning time was recorded for each case. Finally, human experts\nmanually refined the segmentation results until they met their satis\u0002faction. To summarize, the time cost of the second group of annota\u0002tions contained three parts: initial markers, MedSAM inference, and\nrefinement. All the manual annotation processes were based on ITK\u0002SNAP44, an open-source software designed for medical image visuali\u0002zation and annotation.\nEvaluation metrics\nWe followed the recommendations in Metrics Reloaded45 and used the\ndice similarity coefficient and normalized surface distance (NSD) to\nquantitatively evaluate the segmentation results. DSC is a region-based\nsegmentation metric, aiming to evaluate the region overlap between\nexpert annotation masks and segmentation results, which is defined by\nDSC\u00f0G, S\u00de = 2jG \\ Sj\njGj + jSj\n,\nNSD46 is a boundary-based metric, aiming to evaluate the boundary\nconsensus between expert annotation masks and segmentation results\nat a given tolerance, which is defined by\nNSD\u00f0G, S\u00de = j\u2202G \\ B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\n\u2202S j + j\u2202S \\ B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u2202Gj\nj\u2202Gj + j\u2202Sj ,\nwhere B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\n\u2202G = fx 2 R3 j 9x~ 2 \u2202G, jjx \u0001 x~jj \u2264 \u03c4g, B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u2202S = fx 2 R3 j 9x~ 2 \u2202S, jjx \u0001\nx~jj \u2264 \u03c4g denote the border region of the expert annotation mask and\nthe segmentation surface at tolerance \u03c4, respectively. In this paper, we\nset the tolerance \u03c4 as 2.\nStatistical analysis\nTo statistically analyze and compare the performance of the afore\u0002mentioned four methods (MedSAM, SAM, U-Net, and DeepLabV3+\nspecialist models), we employed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. This\nnon-parametric test is well-suited for comparing paired samples and is\nparticularly useful when the data does not meet the assumptions of\nnormal distribution. This analysis allowed us to determine if any\nmethod demonstrated statistically superior segmentation perfor\u0002mance compared to the others, providing valuable insights into the\ncomparative effectiveness of the evaluated methods. The Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank test results are marked on the DSC and NSD score tables\n(Supplementary Table 6\u201311).\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z\nNature Communications | (2024) 15:654 7\nSoftware utilized\nAll code was implemented in Python (3.10) using Pytorch (2.0) as the\nbase deep learning framework.

However, existing methods, often tailored to specific modalities or disease types, lack generalizability across the diverse spectrum of medical image segmentation tasks. Here we present MedSAM, a foundation model designed for bridging this gap by enabling universal medical image segmentation. The model is developed on a large-scale medical image dataset with 1,570,263 image-mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities and over 30 cancer types. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness than modality-wise specialist models. By delivering accurate and efficient segmentation across a wide spectrum of tasks, MedSAM holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of diagnostic tools and the personalization of treatment plans. Segmentation is a fundamental task in medical imaging analysis, which involves identifying and delineating regions of interest (ROI) in various medical images,..",

Accurate segmentation is essential for many clinical applications, including disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of disease progression2,3 . Manual segmentation has long been the gold standard for delineating anatomical structures and pathological regions, but this process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often requires a high degree of expertise. Semi- or fully automatic segmentation methods can significantly reduce the time and labor required, increase consistency, and enable the analysis of large-scale datasets4 . Deep learning-based models have shown great promise in medical image segmentation due to their ability to learn intricate image features and deliver accurate segmentation results across a diverse range of tasks, from segmenting specific anatomical structures to identifying pathological regions5 . However, a significant limitation of many current medical image segmentation models is their task-specific nature. These models are typically designed and trained for a specific segmentation task, and their performance can degrade significantly when applied to new tasks or different types of imaging data6 . This lack of generality poses a substantial obstacle to the wider application of these models in clinical practice. In contrast, recent advances in the field of natural image segmentation have witnessed the emergence of segmentation foundation models, such as segment anything model (SAM)7 and Segment Everything Everywhere with Multi-modal..",

There is a growing demand for universal models in medical image segmentation: models that can be trained once and then applied to a wide range of segmentation tasks. Such models would not only exhibit heightened versatility in terms of model capacity but also potentially lead to more consistent results across different tasks. However, the applicability of the segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM7 ) to medical image segmentation remains limited due to the significant differences between natural images and medical images. Essentially, SAM is a promptable segmentation method that requires points or bounding boxes to specify the segmentation targets. This resembles conventional interactive segmentation methods4,9\u201311 but SAM has better generalization ability, while existing deep learning-based interactive segmentation methods focus mainly on limited tasks and image modalities.

However, the model exhibited substantial limitations in segmenting typical medical targets with weak boundaries or low contrast. In congruence with these observations, we further introduce MedSAM, a refined foundation model that significantly enhances the segmentation performance of SAM on medical images. MedSAM accomplishes this by fine-tuning SAM on an unprecedented dataset with more than one million medical image-mask pairs. We thoroughly evaluate MedSAM through comprehensive experiments on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation tasks, spanning a variety of anatomical structures, pathological conditions, and medical imaging modalities..",
      "s5: ... Experimental results demonstrate that MedSAM consistently outperforms the state-of-theart (SOTA) segmentation foundation model7 , while achieving performance on par with, or even surpassing specialist models1,24 that were trained on the images from the same modality. These results highlight the potential of MedSAM as a new paradigm for versatile medical image segmentation. Results MedSAM: a foundation model for promptable medical image segmentation MedSAM aims to fulfill the role of a foundation model for universal medical image segmentation. A crucial aspect of constructing such a model is the capacity to accommodate a wide range of variations in imaging conditions, anatomical structures, and pathological conditions. To address this challenge, we curated a diverse and large-scale medical image segmentation dataset with 1,570,263 medical imagemask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities, over 30 cancer types, and a multitude of imaging protocols (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Tables 1\u20134). This large-scale dataset allows MedSAM to learn a rich representation of medical images, capturing a broad spectrum of anatomies and lesions across different modalities. Figure 2a provides an overview of the distribution of images across different medical imaging modalities in the dataset, ranked by their total numbers. It is evident that computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI..",
      "s6: ..), and endoscopy are the dominant modalities, reflecting their ubiquity in clinical practice. CT and MRI images provide detailed cross-sectional views of 3D body structures, making them indispensable for non-invasive diagnostic imaging. Endoscopy, albeit more invasive, enables direct visual inspection of organ interiors, proving invaluable for diagnosing gastrointestinal and urological conditions. Despite the prevalence of these modalities, others such as ultrasound, pathology, fundus, dermoscopy, mammography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) also hold significant roles in clinical practice. The diversity of these modalities and their corresponding segmentation targets underscores the necessity for universal and effective segmentation models capable of handling the unique characteristics associated with each modality. Another critical consideration is the selection of the appropriate segmentation prompt and network architecture. While the concept of fully automatic segmentation foundation models is enticing, it is fraught with challenges that make it impractical. One of the primary challenges is the variability inherent in segmentation tasks. For example, given a liver cancer CT image, the segmentation task can vary depending on the specific clinical scenario. One clinician might be Fig. 1 | MedSAM is trained on a large-scale dataset that can handle diverse segmentation tasks.

Additionally, the variability in imaging modalities presents another challenge. Modalities such as CT and MR generate 3D images, whereas others like X-ray and ultrasound yield 2D images. These variabilities in task definition and imaging modalities complicate the design of a fully automatic model capable of accurately anticipating and addressing the diverse requirements of different users. Considering these challenges, we argue that a more practical approach is to develop a promptable 2D segmentation model. The model can be easily adapted to specific tasks based on user-provided prompts, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability. It is also able to handle both 2D and 3D images by processing 3D images as a series of 2D slices. Typical user prompts include points and bounding boxes and we show some segmentation examples with the different prompts in Supplementary Fig. 1. It can be found that bounding boxes provide a more unambiguous spatial context for the region of interest, enabling the algorithm to more precisely discern the target area. This stands in..",

Moreover, drawing a bounding box is efficient, especially in scenarios involving multi-object segmentation. We follow the network architecture in SAM7 , including an image encoder, a prompt encoder, and a mask decoder (Fig. 2b). The image encoder25 maps the input image into a high-dimensional image embedding space. The prompt encoder transforms the user-drawn bounding boxes into feature representations via positional encoding26. Finally, the mask decoder fuses the image embedding and prompt features using cross-attention27 (Methods). Quantitative and qualitative analysis We evaluated MedSAM through both internal validation and external validation. Specifically, we compared it to the SOTA segmentation foundation model SAM7 as well as modality-wise specialist U-Net1 and DeepLabV3+24 models. Each specialized model was trained on images from the corresponding modality, resulting in 10 dedicated specialist models for each method. During inference, these specialist models were used to segment the images from corresponding modalities, while SAM and MedSAM were employed for segmenting images across all modalities (Methods). The internal validation contained 86 segmentation tasks (Supplementary Tables 5\u20138 and Fig. 2), and Fig. 3a shows..",

Overall, SAM obtained the lowest performance on most segmentation tasks although it performed promisingly on some RGB image segmentation tasks, such as polyp (DSC: 91.3%, interquartile range (IQR): 81.2\u201395.1%) segmentation in endoscopy images. This could be attributed to SAM\u2019s training on a variety of RGB images, and the fact that many targets in these images are relatively straightforward to segment due to their distinct appearances. The other three models outperformed SAM by a large margin and MedSAM has a narrower distribution of DSC scores of the 86 interval validation tasks than the two groups of specialist models, reflecting the robustness of MedSAM across different tasks. We further connected the DSC scores corresponding to the same task of the four models with the podium plot Fig. 3b, which is complementary to the box plot. In the upper part, each colored dot denotes the median DSC achieved with the respective method on one task. Dots corresponding to identical test cases are connected by a line.

Figure 3c (and Supplementary Fig. 9) visualizes some randomly selected segmentation examples where MedSAM obtained a median DSC score, including liver tumor in CT images, brain tumor in MR images, breast tumor in ultrasound images, and polyp in endoscopy images. SAM struggles with targets of weak boundaries, which is prone to under or oversegmentation errors. In contrast, MedSAM can accurately segment a wide range of targets across various imaging conditions, which achieves comparable of even better than the specialist U-Net and DeepLabV3+ models. The external validation included 60 segmentation tasks, all of which either were from new datasets or involved unseen segmentation targets (Supplementary Tables 9\u201311 and Figs. 10\u201312). Figure 4a, b show the task-wise median DSC score distribution and their correspondence of the 60 tasks, respectively. Although SAM continued exhibiting lower performance on most CT and MR segmentation tasks, the specialist models no longer consistently outperformed SAM (e.g., right kidney segmentation in MR T1- weighted images: 90.1%, 85.3..",

In contrast, MedSAM consistently delivers superior performance. For example, MedSAM obtained median DSC scores of 87.8% (IQR: 85.0-91.4%) on the nasopharynx cancer segmentation task, demonstrating 52.3%, 15.5%, and 22.7 improvements over SAM, the specialist U-Net, and DeepLabV3+, respectively. Significantly, MedSAM also achieved better performance in some unseen modalities (e.g., abdomen T1 Inphase and Outphase), surpassing SAM and the specialist models with improvements by up to 10%. Figure 4c presents four randomly selected segmentation examples for qualitative evaluation, revealing that while all the methods have the ability to handle simple segmentation targets, MedSAM performs better at segmenting challenging targets with indistinguishable boundaries, such as cervical cancer in MR images (more examples are presented in Supplementary Fig. 13). Furthermore, we evaluated MedSAM on the multiple myeloma plasma cell dataset, which represents a distinct modality and task in contrast to all previously leveraged validation tasks.

The effect of training dataset size We also investigated the effect of varying dataset sizes on MedSAM\u2019s performance because the training dataset size has been proven to be pivotal in model performance28. We additionally trained MedSAM on two different dataset sizes: 10,000 (10K) and 100,000 (100K) images and their performances were compared with the default MedSAM model. The 10K and 100K training..",

As shown in (Fig. 5a) (Supplementary Tables 12\u201314), the performance adhered to the scaling rule, where increasing the number of training images significantly improved the performance in both internal and external validation sets. MedSAM can improve the annotation efficiency Furthermore, we conducted a human annotation study to assess the time cost of two pipelines (Methods). For the first pipeline, two human experts manually annotate 3D adrenal tumors in a slice-by-slice way. For the second pipeline, the experts first drew the long and short tumor axes with the linear marker (initial marker) every 3-10 slices, which is a common practice in tumor response evaluation. Then, MedSAM was used to segment the tumors based on these sparse linear annotations. Finally, the expert manually revised the segmentation results until they were satisfied. We quantitatively compared the annotation time cost between the two pipelines (Fig. 5b). The results demonstrate that with the assistance of MedSAM, the annotation time is substantially reduced by 82.37% and 82.95% for the two experts, respectively.

Its promptable configuration strikes an optimal balance between automation and customization, rendering MedSAM a versatile tool for universal medical image segmentation. Through comprehensive evaluations encompassing both internal and external validation, MedSAM has demonstrated substantial capabilities in segmenting a diverse array of targets and robust generalization abilities to manage new data and tasks. Its performance not only significantly exceeds that of existing the state-of-the-art segmentation foundation model, but also rivals or even surpasses specialist models. By providing precise delineation of anatomical structures and pathological regions, MedSAM facilitates the computation of various quantitative measures that serve as biomarkers. For instance, in the field of oncology, MedSAM could play a crucial role in accelerating the 3D tumor annotation process, enabling subsequent calculations of tumor volume, which is a critical biomarker29 for assessing disease progression and response to treatment. Additionally, MedSAM provides a successful paradigm for adapting natural image foundation models to new domains, which can be further extended to biological image segmentation30, such as cell segmentation in light microscopy images31 and organelle segmentation in electron microscopy images32. While MedSAM boasts strong capabilities, it does present certain limitations. One such..",
      "s17: ..limitation is the modality imbalance in the training set, with CT, MRI, and endoscopy images dominating the dataset. This could potentially impact the model\u2019s performance on less-represented modalities, such as mammography. Another limitation is its difficulty in the segmentation of vessel-like branching structures because the bounding box prompt can be ambiguous in this setting. For example, arteries and veins share the same bounding box in eye fundus images. However, these limitations do not diminish MedSAM\u2019s utility. Since MedSAM has learned rich and representative medical image features from the large-scale training set, it can be finetuned to effectively segment new tasks from less-represented modalities or intricate structures like vessels. In conclusion, this study highlights the feasibility of constructing a single foundation model capable of managing a multitude of segmentation tasks, thereby eliminating the need for task-specific models. MedSAM, as the inaugural foundation model in medical image segmentation, holds great potential to accelerate the advancement of new diagnostic and therapeutic tools, and ultimately contribute to improved patient care33.

All the datasets provided segmentation annotations by human experts, which have been widely used in existing literature (Supplementary Table 1\u20134). We incorporated these annotations directly for both model development and validation. The original 3D datasets consisted of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images in DICOM, nrrd, or mhd formats. To ensure uniformity and compatibility with developing medical image deep learning models, we converted the images to the widely used NifTI format. Additionally, grayscale images (such as X-Ray and Ultrasound) as well as RGB images (including endoscopy, dermoscopy, fundus, and pathology images), were converted to the png format.

      "s19: ..) 15:654 5 Several exclusive criteria are applied to improve the dataset quality and consistency, including incomplete images and segmentation targets with branching structures, inaccurate annotations, and tiny volumes. Notably, image intensities varied significantly across different modalities. For instance, CT images had intensity values ranging from -2000 to 2000, while MR images exhibited a range of 0 to 3000. In endoscopy and ultrasound images, intensity values typically spanned from 0 to 255. To facilitate stable training, we performed intensity normalization across all images, ensuring they shared the same intensity range. For CT images, we initially normalized the Hounsfield units using typical window width and level values. The employed window width and level values for soft tissues, lung, and brain are (W:400, L:40), (W:1500, L:-160), and (W:80, L:40), respectively. Subsequently, the intensity values were rescaled to the range of [0, 255]. For MR, X-ray, ultrasound, mammography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, we clipped the intensity values to the range between the 0.5th and 99.5th percentiles before rescaling them to the range of [0, 255]. Regarding RGB images (e...",
      "s20: ..g., endoscopy, dermoscopy, fundus, and pathology images), if they were already within the expected intensity range of [0, 255], their intensities remained unchanged. However, if they fell outside this range, we utilized max-min normalization to rescale the intensity values to [0, 255]. Finally, to meet the model\u2019s input requirements, all images were resized to a uniform size of 1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3. In the case of whole-slide pathology images, patches were extracted using a sliding window approach without overlaps. The patches located on boundaries were padded to this size with 0. As for 3D CT and MR images, each 2D slice was resized to 1024 \u00d7 1024, and the channel was repeated three times to maintain consistency. The remaining 2D images were directly resized to 1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3. Bi-cubic interpolation was used for resizing images, while nearest-neighbor interpolation was applied for resizing masks to preserve their precise boundaries and avoid introducing unwanted artifacts. These standardization procedures ensured uniformity and compatibility across all images and facilitated seamless integration into the subsequent stages of the model training and evaluation pipeline. Network architecture The network utilized in this study was built on transformer architecture27, which has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in various domains such as natural language..",

Specifically, the network incorporated a vision transformer (ViT)-based image encoder responsible for extracting image features, a prompt encoder for integrating user interactions (bounding boxes), and a mask decoder that generated segmentation results and confidence scores using the image embedding, prompt embedding, and output token. To strike a balance between segmentation performance and computational efficiency, we employed the base ViT model as the image encoder since extensive evaluation indicated that larger ViT models, such as ViT Large and ViT Huge, offered only marginal improvements in accuracy7 while significantly increasing computational demands. Specifically, the base ViT model consists of 12 transformer layers27, with each block comprising a multi-head self-attention block and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) block incorporating layer normalization35. Pre-training was performed using masked auto-encoder modeling36, followed by fully supervised training on the SAM dataset7 . The input image (1024 \u00d7 1024 \u00d7 3) was reshaped into a sequence of flattened 2D patches with the size 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 3, yielding a feature size in image embedding of 64 \u00d7 64 after passing through the image encoder, which is 16 \u00d7 downscaled. The prompt encoders mapped the corner point of the bounding box prompt to..",

To facilitate realtime user interactions once the image embedding had been computed, a lightweight mask decoder architecture was employed. It consists of two transformer layers27 for fusing the image embedding and prompt encoding, and two transposed convolutional layers to enhance the embedding resolution to 256 \u00d7 256. Subsequently, the embedding underwent sigmoid activation, followed by bi-linear interpolations to match the input size. Training protocol and experimental setting During data pre-processing, we obtained 1,570,263 medical imagemask pairs for model development and validation. For internal validation, we randomly split the dataset into 80%, 10%, and 10% as training, tuning, and validation, respectively. Specifically, for modalities where within-scan continuity exists, such as CT and MRI, and modalities where continuity exists between consecutive frames, we performed the data splitting at the 3D scan and the video level respectively, by which any potential data leak was prevented. For pathology images, recognizing the significance of slide-level cohesiveness, we first separated the whole-slide images into distinct slidebased sets. Then, each slide was divided into small patches with a fixed size..",

For the external validation, all datasets were held out and did not appear during model training. These datasets provide a stringent test of the model\u2019s generalization ability, as they represent new patients, imaging conditions, and potentially new segmentation tasks that the model has not encountered before. By evaluating the performance of MedSAM on these unseen datasets, we can gain a realistic understanding of how MedSAM is likely to perform in real-world clinical settings, where it will need to handle a wide range of variability and unpredictability in the data. The training and validation are independent. The model was initialized with the pre-trained SAM model with the ViT-Base model. We fixed the prompt encoder since it can already encode the bounding box prompt. All the trainable parameters in the image encoder and mask decoder were updated during training. Specifically, the number of trainable parameters for the image encoder and mask decoder are 89,670,912 and 4,058,340, respectively.

The network was optimized by AdamW37 optimizer (\u03b21 = 0.9, \u03b22 = 0.999) with an initial learning rate of 1e-4 and a weight decay of 0.01. The global batch size was 160 and data augmentation was not used. The model was trained on 20 A100 (80G) GPUs with 150 epochs and the last checkpoint was selected as the final model. Furthermore, to thoroughly evaluate the performance of MedSAM, we conducted comparative analyses against both the state-ofthe-art segmentation foundation model SAM7 and specialist models (i.e., U-Net1 and DeepLabV3+24). The training images contained 10 modalities: CT, MR, chest X-ray (CXR), dermoscopy, endoscopy, ultrasound, mammography, OCT, and pathology, and we trained the U-Net and DeepLabV3+ specialist models for each modality. There were 20 specialist models in total and the number of corresponding training images was presented in Supplementary Table 5. We employed the nnU-Net to conduct all U-Net experiments, which can automatically configure the network architecture based on the dataset..",

This function was originally supported by nnU-Net in the cascaded pipeline, which has demonstrated increased performance in many segmentation tasks by using the binary mask as an additional channel to specify the target location. The training settings followed the default configurations of 2D nnU-Net. Each model was trained on one A100 GPU with 1000 Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-44824-z Nature Communications | (2024) 15:654 6 epochs and the last checkpoint was used as the final model.

In contrast, the U-Net and DeepLabV3+ specialist models were used to individually segment the respective corresponding modalities. A task-specific segmentation model might outperform a modalitybased one for certain applications. Since U-Net obtained better performance than DeepLabV3+ on most tasks, we further conducted a comparison study by training task-specific U-Net models on four representative tasks, including liver cancer segmentation in CT scans, abdominal organ segmentation in MR scans, nerve cancer segmentation in ultrasound, and polyp segmentation in endoscopy images. The experiments included both internal validation and external validation. For internal validation, we adhered to the default data splits, using them to train the task-specific U-Net models and then evaluate their performance on the corresponding validation set. For external validation, the trained U-Net models were evaluated on new datasets from the same modality or segmentation targets. In all these experiments, MedSAM was directly applied to the validation sets without additional fine-tuning.

We randomly sampled 10 cases, comprising a total of 733 tumor slices requiring annotations. Two human experts participated in this study, both of whom are experienced radiologists with 8 and 6 years of clinical practice in abdominal diseases, respectively. Each expert generated two groups of annotations, one with the assistance of MedSAM and one without. In the first group, the experts manually annotated the 3D adrenal tumor in a slice-by-slice manner. Annotations by the two experts were conducted independently, with no collaborative discussions, and the time taken for each case was recorded. In the second group, annotations were generated after one week of cooling period. The experts independently drew the long and short tumor axes as initial markers, which is a common practice in tumor response evaluation. This process was executed every 3-10 slices from the top slice to the bottom slice of the tumor. Then, we applied MedSAM to segment the tumors based on these sparse linear annotations, including three steps. \u2022 Step 1.

We transformed the binary masks into bounding boxes and then fed them along with the images into MedSAM to generate segmentation results. All these steps were conducted in an automatic way and the model running time was recorded for each case. Finally, human experts manually refined the segmentation results until they met their satisfaction. To summarize, the time cost of the second group of annotations contained three parts: initial markers, MedSAM inference, and refinement. All the manual annotation processes were based on ITKSNAP44, an open-source software designed for medical image visualization and annotation. Evaluation metrics We followed the recommendations in Metrics Reloaded45 and used the dice similarity coefficient and normalized surface distance (NSD) to quantitatively evaluate the segmentation results. DSC is a region-based segmentation metric, aiming to evaluate the region overlap between expert annotation masks and segmentation results, which is defined by DSC\u00f0G, S\u00de = 2jG \\ Sj jGj + jSj , NSD46 is a boundary-based metric, aiming to evaluate the boundary consensus between expert annotation masks and segmentation results at a given tolerance, which is defined by NSD\u00f0G, S\u00de = j\u2202G \\ B\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u2202S j + j..",

In this paper, we set the tolerance \u03c4 as 2. Statistical analysis To statistically analyze and compare the performance of the aforementioned four methods (MedSAM, SAM, U-Net, and DeepLabV3+ specialist models), we employed the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. This non-parametric test is well-suited for comparing paired samples and is particularly useful when the data does not meet the assumptions of normal distribution. This analysis allowed us to determine if any method demonstrated statistically superior segmentation performance compared to the others, providing valuable insights into the comparative effectiveness of the evaluated methods. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test results are marked on the DSC and NSD score tables (Supplementary Table 6\u201311). Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s..",

    "report_generated": "# Universal Medical Image Segmentation: A Literature Synthesis\n\n## Introduction\nMedical image segmentation is a pivotal task in clinical settings, enabling precise diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of disease progression. Despite its importance, current segmentation methods often lack the versatility needed to handle the diverse range of medical imaging tasks\u3010s1\u3011\u3010s2\u3011.\n\n## Background\nTraditional segmentation techniques, including manual and semi-automatic methods, have been the gold standard in clinical practice. However, these approaches are time-consuming and require significant expertise\u3010s2\u3011. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in automating segmentation tasks, yet these models are typically designed for specific tasks and struggle with generalizability\u3010s2\u3011\u3010s3\u3011.\n\n## Literature Synthesis\n### Limitations of Current Models\nExisting deep learning models for medical image segmentation are often tailored to specific modalities or disease types. This specialization limits their applicability across different imaging conditions and anatomical structures\u3010s2\u3011\u3010s3\u3011. For instance, models trained on CT images may not perform well on MRI or ultrasound data\u3010s6\u3011.\n\n### Advances in Segmentation Models\nRecent developments in natural image segmentation have introduced foundation models capable of handling a wide array of tasks. These models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), demonstrate remarkable versatility and performance across various segmentation challenges\u3010s3\u3011\u3010s4\u3011. However, their application to medical images remains limited due to the inherent differences between natural and medical images\u3010s3\u3011.\n\n### Need for Universal Models\nThe demand for universal segmentation models in medical imaging is growing. Such models would not only enhance versatility but also ensure consistent results across different tasks and modalities\u3010s3\u3011\u3010s5\u3011. The concept of a promptable segmentation model, which can be adapted to specific tasks through user-provided prompts, offers a promising solution\u3010s7\u3011\u3010s8\u3011.\n\n## Hypothesis Formulation\nBuilding on the synthesis of existing literature, it is hypothesized that a universal segmentation model, trained on a diverse and large-scale dataset, can achieve superior performance across various medical imaging tasks. This model would leverage the strengths of foundation models while addressing the unique challenges posed by medical images\u3010s5\u3011\u3010s6\u3011.\n\nIn conclusion, the synthesis of existing literature underscores the potential of developing a universal model for medical image segmentation. Such a model could revolutionize clinical practice by providing accurate and efficient segmentation across a wide spectrum of tasks, ultimately improving patient care\u3010s16\u3011\u3010s17\u3011."

Supplier Relationship\nManagement (SRM) is widely recognized as a crucial method for achieving this goal, as\nevidenced by numerous studies conducted in well-established industrial settings, such as the\nUnited States (Farooque et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2021) and Germany (Reu et al., 2019). These\nstudies, conducted on a worldwide scale, have highlighted the positive influence of proficient SRM\nstrategies on various aspects of supply chain performance, including supplier performance, cost\neffectiveness, product quality, and delivery punctuality. As global industries continue to evolve,\nemerging economies like Bangladesh have become prominent participants in the international\nmarketplace.\nIn the specific context of Bangladesh, a country experiencing rapid economic growth and a\nflourishing industrial sector, the significance of efficient SRM cannot be emphasized enough. In\nrecent years, Bangladesh has demonstrated significant progress in establishing itself as a\nprominent participant in the worldwide supply chain, with a particular focus on industries such\ntextiles, ready-made clothing, and electronics (Fouji & Hoque, 2021). Due to its expanding industrial\nsector and extensive supplier network, the nation has emerged as an appealing destination for\nforeign enterprises in search of economically efficient manufacturing and sourcing alternatives. The\nobserved evolution serves as evidence of Bangladesh's capacity inside the international\nmarketplace. Nevertheless, it is crucial to examine the impact of SRM techniques on the\nperformance of supply chains functioning in Bangladesh, as the country takes on its position in the\nglobal supply chain. Although there exists a considerable body of literature on SRM, a significant\nproportion of the study has mostly concentrated on industrialized economies. Consequently, there\nis a notable knowledge gap about the application and effectiveness of SRM in emerging economies\nsuch as Bangladesh. The distinctive environment of Bangladesh, characterized by its economic,\ncultural, and infrastructural intricacies, warrants a focused examination (Hossain et al., 2023).\nThe primary objective of the present study is to fill the existing research void by quantitatively\nexamining the impact of SRM on enhancing supply chain performance in the context of Bangladesh.\nThis investigation will build upon the knowledge gained from prior research conducted on a\nworldwide scale. For instance, research conducted in the United States by Farooque et al., (2022)\nand in Germany by Reu\u00df et al., (2019) emphasized the favorable influence of proficient SRM\nstrategies on various aspects, including supplier performance, cost effectiveness, product quality,\nand delivery punctuality. The conducted research, carried out in established industrial contexts,\nhas yielded significant reference points for SRM procedures. Nevertheless, the specific economic,\ncultural, and infrastructural complexities of Bangladesh give rise to a separate framework that\ncould potentially impact the dynamics of SRM in a distinct manner. The current study seeks to fill\nthis void by particularly examining the Bangladeshi context, so adding a nuanced viewpoint to the\nexisting pool of information. Through the analysis of SRM in an emerging country, this study aims\nto reveal unique perspectives that may diverge from findings in research undertaken in\nindustrialized countries. A comprehensive comprehension of how SRM methods affect\nperformance metrics is essential due to the unique difficulties and possibilities present in the\nsupply chain ecosystem of Bangladesh. The study offers a fresh viewpoint by examining the\nutilization and efficacy of SRM in a distinctive and ever-changing economic environment, providing\nvaluable insights that might enhance both theoretical understanding and practical implementation\nin the worldwide domain of supply chain management. Although several studies have investigated\nthe concept of SRM in developed economies, there is a notable scarcity of study that focuses on\nexamining this phenomenon within the unique context of Bangladesh. Prior studies conducted in\nthis domain have yielded significant findings pertaining to the correlations between SRM methods\nand key performance indicators (KPIs) within supply chain management. For example, research\ndone in the United States (Farooque et al., 2019) and Germany (Reu\u00df et al., 2019) has emphasized\nthe favorable influence of proficient SRM strategies on supplier performance, cost effectiveness,\nproduct quality, and delivery punctuality. The studies highlight the significance of SRM in improving\nmany facets of supply chain performance. Moreover, scholarly investigations conducted in\ndeveloping nations, such as India, have provided evidence of the significance of SRM strategies in\nenhancing cost effectiveness (Queiroz & Wamba, 2019). Numerous studies undertaken in various\ninternational settings have continuously underscored the significance of collaboration, information\nsharing, and trust-building between buyers and suppliers as pivotal elements of effective SRM\n(Hoang et al., 2023).\nAs Bangladesh strives to establish itself as a significant participant in the global supply chain, it\nis imperative to thoroughly investigate the suitability and efficacy of SRM approaches in this distinct\nsetting, as shown by previous study findings. Therefore, the present study aims to expand upon\nthe existing body of research by directing its attention towards the supply chains of Bangladesh.\nThis study seeks to give significant insights for practitioners and policymakers acting within the\nBangladeshi context by examining the correlation between SRM techniques and key supply chain\nperformance indicators, including Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n3/18\nEvaluation and Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships.\nPrevious research has provided valuable insights into the impact of SRM on supply chain\nperformance at a global level. However, this study seeks to expand this knowledge by examining\nthe specific context of Bangladesh. By doing so, it aims to contribute to a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of how SRM influences supply chain dynamics in emerging economies. Despite the\nincreasing significance of SRM, there exists a dearth of empirical studies examining its influence on\nsupply chain performance within the context of Bangladesh. The objective of this study is to\naddress the existing research gap by investigating the precise connections between SRM methods\nand measures of supply chain performance. The value of this study is derived from its contribution\nto the existing body of knowledge on SRM specifically within the setting of Bangladesh. It\ncontributes to the understanding of the advantages that may be gained by implementing successful\nSRM tactics. The primary objective of this study is to examine the manufacturing and service sectors\nin Bangladesh. The research will span enterprises of diverse sizes and operational complexities in\norder to conduct a thorough evaluation of SRM techniques and their influence on the performance\nof supply chains.\n2 EMPIRICAL LITERATURE AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT\n2.1 Supplier relationship management and supply chain performance\nSRM is a critical aspect of modern supply chain management (Adesanya et al., 2020). It involves\ndeveloping dynamic partnerships between businesses and their suppliers (Sharma et al., 2020).\nSRM focuses on creating lasting and mutually beneficial relationships beyond mere transactions\n(Enz & Lambert, 2023). In today's competitive landscape, strong supplier relationships are vital for\nsuccess (Amoako-Gyampah et al., 2019). SRM goes beyond transactions, encompassing strategic\ncollaboration, innovation, and value generation (Pereira et al., 2022). This review examines SRM's\nimpact on supply chain performance, including cost efficiency, product quality, on-time delivery,\nand customer satisfaction. SRM has evolved from transactional interactions to strategic alliances\n(Abbas & Tong, 2023). Recognizing suppliers as essential partners shifted the focus to collaboration\nand long-term partnerships. Technological advancements improved SRM's efficiency, with digital\nplatforms enhancing communication (Emon & Nahid, 2023; Tseng, 2020). Strong relationships with\nsuppliers stimulate innovation and value creation (Lee & Tang, 2018). SRM now encompasses\ncollaborative partnerships, risk management, supplier development, and sustainability (Emon &\nKhan, 2023; Huma et al., 2020). Empirical studies show that proficient SRM positively impacts\nsupplier performance, cost-effectiveness, product quality, and delivery punctuality (Le Jr, 2022).\nCollaboration, information exchange, and trust development are key foundations of successful\nSRM (Cha & Kim, 2018). Supplier development activities enhance supplier performance (Mani et al.,\n2018).\n2.2 Supplier Collaboration and Supply Chain Performance:\nSRM highlights the importance of strategic collaboration as a fundamental element for\nachieving success in the current dynamic and competitive supply chain environment (Oduro et al.,\n2020). There is a large body of literature that strongly supports the notion that successful\ncollaboration with suppliers plays a crucial role in improving the performance of the supply chain.\nThis section examines the current studies on how supplier collaboration affects several aspects of\nsupply chain performance and builds upon the literature presented by Oduro et al., (2020).\nCollaborative relationships in SRM go beyond standard transactional methods and play a crucial\nrole in promoting innovation, enhancing product quality, assuring timely delivery, and ultimately\nimproving customer happiness (Abtahi et al., 2023; Stek & Schiele, 2021). The development of SRM\nhas experienced a significant change from transactional interactions to the formation of strategic\npartnerships, emphasizing the crucial role of collaboration in creating and sustaining long-term\nrelationships with suppliers (Yang, 2022). The growing interdependence and global integration of\nsupply chains has underscored the importance of strong collaborative methods. Technological\nimprovements are crucial in enabling and enhancing collaborative efforts in SRM. Digital platforms\nhave become crucial instruments that not only facilitate communication but also improve the\nsharing of information between organizations and their suppliers (Ebinger & Omondi, 2020). These\nplatforms facilitate instantaneous data exchange, which is essential for efficient collaboration,\nespecially in a multinational supply chain setting where prompt information is vital.\nAlthough (Leiras & Fontainha, 2019; Oduro et al., 2020) have shed light on the beneficial effects\nof supplier collaboration on supply chain performance, there may still be gaps and unexplored\nareas in the existing literature. The purpose of this part is to identify the gaps in the current\nunderstanding of how supplier collaboration affects supply chain performance. It also highlights\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n4/18\nthe specific contributions of this study in addressing and enhancing the existing knowledge in this\narea. This study seeks to further the knowledge of the complex relationship between collaborative\npractices and supply chain performance by combining additional literature that addresses subtle\naspects of supplier collaboration.\n2.3 Supplier Development and Supply Chain Performance\nSupplier development activities are acknowledged as key elements in the larger context of SRM,\nserving a vital function in improving supplier performance and, subsequently, overall supply chain\nefficiency (Dubey et al., 2019). This part performs a thorough examination of the current body of\nresearch to investigate the complex connection between supplier development and supply chain\nperformance, expanding upon the knowledge presented by Dubey et al., (2019). Supplier\ndevelopment goes beyond conventional transactional methods and encompasses a range of\nactions aimed at improving the talents and performance of suppliers (Awan et al., 2019). Activities\nmay encompass training programs, streamlining processes, embracing technology, and engaging\nin collaborative projects with the goal of promoting innovation and ongoing enhancement.\nAccording to the literature, supplier development programs that are successful contribute to better\nsupplier performance, which in turn leads to cost-effectiveness and increased efficiency in the\nsupply chain (Asif et al., 2022).\nAlthough the current body of literature offers significant insights into the favorable relationship\nbetween supplier development and supply chain performance, there are still intricacies and unique\nmechanisms that warrant further investigation. Gaining insight into the impact of different\nelements of supplier development on various facets of supply chain performance is essential for\nformulating focused and efficient strategies. This section seeks to highlight any existing gaps in the\ncurrent knowledge and clarify how the present study helps to filling these gaps by offering a\ndetailed perspective on the complex connection between supplier development activities and the\noverall performance of the supply chain.\n2.4 Supplier Evaluation and Supply Chain Performance:\nEffective SRM relies on the use of strong supplier assessment methods, which are essential for\nachieving optimal supply chain efficiency (Amoako-Gyampah et al., 2019; Klingebiel et al., 2013).\nThis section provides a comprehensive analysis of the current research on the complex connection\nbetween supplier evaluation and the overall performance of the supply chain. It expands on the\nfundamental findings presented by Amoako-Gyampah et al., (2019). Supplier evaluation in the\ncontext of SRM entails a thorough examination of supplier performance, cost efficiency, product\nquality, and delivery timeliness (Lim et al., 2021). Proficient SRM has been found to have a favorable\nimpact on supplier evaluation, leading to improvements in several aspects of supply chain\nperformance, as indicated by the existing literature. However, there may be gaps in our present\nunderstanding of how the precise criteria used in supplier assessment processes are closely\nconnected to various aspects of supply chain performance. The purpose of this section is to identify\nand explain the gaps in the current knowledge, by conducting a detailed analysis of the relationship\nbetween different criteria used to evaluate suppliers and various aspects of supply chain\nperformance. Through this approach, it aims to enhance and improve the theoretical foundation\nthat supports the connection between supplier evaluation methods and the overall efficacy of the\nsupply chain.\n2.5 Long-Term Supplier Relationship and Supply Chain Performance:\nLong-term supplier connections play a crucial role in SRM, exerting substantial impact on supply\nchain performance (Oduro et al., 2020). This part provides a thorough examination of the current\nresearch, exploring the complex connection between long-term relationships with suppliers and\nthe various factors that affect supply chain effectiveness. The fundamental knowledge presented\nby Shakeel et al., (2018) acts as a crucial basis for this investigation. Organizations have recognized\nthe importance of suppliers as crucial partners and have therefore made it a strategic priority to\ndevelop long-term relationships. This involves focusing on collaboration and mutual benefits under\nthe SRM framework (Kannan, 2018). Empirical research confirm that long-term supplier\nrelationships have a beneficial effect on different measures of supply chain performance. However,\nthere may be gaps in our current understanding regarding the detailed mechanisms by which these\nlinkages contribute to the complex fabric of supply chain performance. This section aims to\nthoroughly identify any potential gaps in the current literature, with the goal of clarifying how the\npresent study enhances the understanding of the relationship between long-term supplier\nrelationships and various aspects of supply chain performance. In order to improve the scope and\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n5/18\ncomprehensiveness of this analysis, it will be crucial to include contemporary research and a variety\nof viewpoints on long-term supplier partnerships. This section aims to add to both theoretical\nrefinement and practical insights for businesses managing long-term supplier relationships within\nthe broader framework of SRM.\n2.6 Theoretical Frameworks in SRM\nUnderstanding Supplier Relationship Management's (SRM) theoretical foundations and\nevolution is essential to grasp its dynamics. Originally transactional, SRM has evolved into a\nstrategic approach focusing on long-term value (Dash et al., 2018). Theoretical dimensions include\ntransaction cost minimization, resource leverage, incentive alignment, and risk management (Rejeb\net al., 2021). The evolution of Transaction Cost Economics (TCE), Resource-Based View (RBV), and\nAgency Theory has mirrored SRM's transformation. Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) emphasizes\nminimizing transaction costs in SRM (Swallehe, 2021). Resource-Based View (RBV) highlights\nsupplier relationships as sources of competitive advantage (Andersen, 2021). Agency Theory\naddresses agency issues within supplier relationships (Dubey et al., 2019). These theories intersect\nin SRM to reduce costs, leverage resources, align incentives, and manage risks (Gilmore & Buhaug,\n2021).\nDepending upon the theoretical underpinnings elucidated in the comprehensive examination\nof existing literature, the present section delineates the conceptual framework that will guide the\ninvestigation. The theoretical framework selected for this study is the Resource-Based View (RBV),\nwhich asserts that businesses can attain enduring competitive advantage via the strategic\nutilization of distinctive resources and skills. across the scope of this study, the Resource-Based\nView (RBV) framework offers a perspective that enables the examination of how SRM methods\nimpact a particular outcome variable, namely cost efficiency, across supply chains operating in\nBangladesh. The Resource-Based View (RBV) theory places significant emphasis on the significance\nof supplier relationships as important sources of resources and capabilities that ultimately promote\ncost effectiveness within supply chains. The resources and capabilities obtained through SRM\ntechniques are anticipated to have a favorable impact on cost efficiency. This is demonstrated by\nthe potential to attain cost reductions, cost savings, and cost-effectiveness in supply chain activities.\n2.7 Research Hypotheses & Conceptual Framework\nSupplier collaboration: The implementation of supplier collaboration, which involves engaging\nin cooperative activities and sharing knowledge with suppliers, has been demonstrated to improve\nTable 1 - Theoretical Frameworks in SRM\nTheoretical\nFramework\nKey Concepts and Relevance Sources\nTransaction Cost\nEconomics\n- Minimizing transaction costs in\nsupplier relationships.\n(Rindfleisch, 2020; Schmidt &\nWagner, 2019; Stone, 1986)\n- Aligning SRM practices with\ntransaction-specific\ncharacteristics.\n(Macher & Richman, 2008; Saad\net al., 2022; Wynstra et al., 2019)\nResource-Based\nView\n- Leveraging supplier\nrelationships as sources of\ncompetitive advantage.\n(Barney, 1991; Nandi et al., 2020;\nShibin et al., 2020)\n- Recognizing supplier-specific\nassets, knowledge, and\ncapabilities.\n(Burki et al., 2023; Saghiri &\nMirzabeiki, 2021; Wernerfelt,\n1984)\nAgency Theory - Addressing agency problems\nand information asymmetry in\nSRM.\n(Dong et al., 2021; Jensen &\nMeckling, 2019; Kummer et al.,\n2020)\n- Designing SRM practices to align\nincentives between organizations\nand suppliers.\n(Ali et al., 2020; Dubey et al.,\n2019; Eisenhardt, 1989)\n- Monitoring and control\nmechanisms in SRM\nrelationships.\n(Fama, 1980; Songsom et al.,\n2019)\n- The role of contracts and\nperformance-based incentives in\nSRM.\n(Grum et al., 2023; Milgrom et al.,\n1992)\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n6/18\nthe operational efficiency of supply chain processes. Collaboration of this nature has the potential\nto enhance communication, optimize procedures, and enhance coordination, hence yielding cost\nefficiencies. Prior studies have provided evidence that the establishment of successful\ncollaboration with suppliers has a beneficial influence on cost efficiency (Cole & Aitken, 2019;\nPaparoidamis et al., 2019), thus confirming the premise of a positive association.\nH0: Supplier collaboration has no significant influence on cost efficiency in the supply chains of\nBangladeshi organizations.\nH1: Supplier collaboration has a significant positive influence on cost efficiency in the supply\nchains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nSupplier development: Supplier development programs, encompassing activities such as\ntraining and knowledge transfer, possess the capacity to augment the capabilities of suppliers,\nhence resulting in enhancements to processes and reductions in costs. Previous studies have\ndemonstrated that supplier development initiatives have a favorable impact on cost effectiveness\n(Awan et al., 2019; Sikombe & Phiri, 2019), hence substantiating the proposition of a positive\ncorrelation.\nH0: Supplier development efforts have no significant impact on cost efficiency in the supply\nchains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nH2: Supplier development efforts have a significant positive impact on cost efficiency in the\nsupply chains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nSupplier Evaluation and Selection: The implementation of effective supplier evaluation and\nselection methods is crucial in ensuring that organizations establish partnerships with dependable\nand high-performing suppliers. Efficient evaluation procedures are anticipated to result in\nimproved selection of suppliers, hence positively influencing cost effectiveness through the\nmitigation of quality-related concerns and supply disruptions. The favorable association between\nsupplier evaluation and selection and cost efficiency has been supported by empirical research\nconducted by Kannan (2018) and Naghshineh & Carvalho (2022) (Kannan, 2018; Naghshineh &\nCarvalho, 2022).\nH0: Effective supplier evaluation and selection practices have no significant effect on cost\nefficiency in the supply chains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nH3: Effective supplier evaluation and selection practices have a significant positive effect on cost\nefficiency in the supply chains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nLong-Term Supplier Relationships: The establishment and maintenance of enduring\nconnections with essential suppliers contribute to the cultivation of trust, collaboration, and shared\ncomprehension. These attributes are frequently linked with enhanced operational efficiency and\nless interruptions, hence contributing to cost-effectiveness. Prior studies have demonstrated that\nestablishing enduring partnerships with suppliers has a favorable impact on cost effectiveness\n(Herczeg et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2023), hence lending weight to the proposition of a positive\nassociation.\nH0: Long-term supplier relationships have no significant impact on cost efficiency in the supply\nchains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nH4: Long-term supplier relationships have a significant positive impact on cost efficiency in the\nsupply chains of Bangladeshi organizations.\nThe conceptual framework includes SRM practices as independent variables and supply chain\nperformance indicators (cost efficiency) as dependent variables. As illustrated in Figure 1 the four\nindependent variables namely Supplier collaboration, Supplier development, Supplier Evaluation\nand Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships have been presented in the left side of the\ndiagram and dependent variable cost efficiency is presented in the Right side of the diagram. The\nrelationships between each independent variable and the dependent variable are indicated by the\nfour-research hypothesis connecting the variables through the arrows.\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n7/18\nFigure 1 - Conceptual Framework\n3. MATERIAL AND METHODS\nThe research design employed for this study is quantitative, aiming to comprehensively\ninvestigate the relationship between SRM practices and cost efficiency in the supply chains of firms\noperating in Bangladesh. The study focuses on one main category of variables: independent\nvariables representing SRM practices and one dependent variable representing cost efficiency. In\nterms of independent variables, the study encompasses four dimensions of SRM practices. Supplier\nCollaboration, the variable in question quantifies the extent of collaboration and information\nexchange between enterprises and their suppliers. This statement elucidates the degree to which\nfirms partake in collaborative endeavors and exchange information with suppliers in order to\nenhance cost effectiveness within their supply chains (Tai et al., 2022). Supplier Development, this\nvariable evaluates the endeavors undertaken by enterprises to enhance the capabilities and\nresources of their suppliers. The initiatives encompass many strategies, such as training programs,\ntechnology transfer endeavors, and collaborative projects focused on enhancing process efficiency\nwith the goal of attaining cost effectiveness (Gu et al., 2021). Supplier Evaluation and Selection, this\nvariable investigates the criteria and procedures employed by firms to assess, choose, and oversee\ntheir suppliers. The concept incorporates various elements such as assessments of supplier\nperformance, evaluations of quality, and procedures related to risk management, all of which have\nan impact on cost efficiency (Dobos & V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, 2019). Long-Term Supplier Relationships, this\ncharacteristic pertains to the temporal extent and steadfastness of the associations established\nbetween organizations and their suppliers. The metric assesses the degree to which firms sustain\nenduring collaborations with crucial suppliers, which can have a lasting impact on cost effectiveness\n(Mohan et al., 2021). The dependent variable, Cost Efficiency, the dependent variable in question\nmeasures the degree of cost-effectiveness exhibited by supply chain operations. The\nmeasurements encompassed in this category consist of cost reduction, cost savings, and supply\nchain cost-to-revenue ratios (Panfilova et al., 2020). The study's setting was Bangladesh, with a\nspecific focus on organizations in various sectors, including manufacturing and services. The study\ninvolved a Convenience sampling technique to ensure representation from both manufacturing\nand service sectors. Data were collected from multiple departments or individuals responsible for\nSRM and supply chain operations within each firm, such as procurement, supply chain\nmanagement, and strategic management. The participants, selected based on their roles and\nresponsibilities related to SRM practices, included managers, procurement officers, and individuals\ninvolved in supply chain decision-making processes. A sample size of 270 individuals was\ndetermined to strike a balance between practicality and the requirement for statistical significance,\nconsidering the constraints of convenience sampling. Data were collected through a structured\nsurvey instrument consisting of 22 items, representing independent and dependent variables. The\nLikert scale was used to measure responses, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The\nsurvey instrument was developed based on a thorough review of existing literature and validated\nscales used in previous studies. Quantitative techniques, including regression analysis and\ncorrelation analysis, were applied for data analysis using SPSS 22 to assess the relationships\nbetween SRM practices and cost efficiency. These statistical methods aimed to provide insights into\nthe extent to which SRM practices influenced cost efficiency in the context of Bangladeshi firms.\nThroughout the research process, ethical considerations, including informed consent, data\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n8/18\nconfidentiality, and anonymity, were meticulously maintained to ensure the integrity and ethical\nconduct of the study. The reliability of the measurements was assessed through techniques such\nas Cronbach's alpha for survey instruments. The study aimed to minimize measurement errors and\nensure the reliability of collected data.\nTable 2 - Reliability of the Measurements\nConstruct Item No Cronbach\u2019s alpha\nSupplier Collaboration 5 .911\nSupplier Development 5 .922\nSupplier Evaluation and Selection 5 .876\nLong Term Supplier\nRelationships\n5 .917\nCost Efficiency 2 .854\nThe reliability of the measurements was assessed through Cronbach\u2019s alpha values for each\nconstruct in Table 2. The results indicate high internal consistency and reliability among the items\nmeasuring Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Long-Term Supplier Relationships, and\nCost Efficiency, with Cronbach\u2019s alpha values of .911, .922, .917, and .854, respectively. The\nconstruct of Supplier Evaluation and Selection also exhibits good internal consistency, with a\nCronbach\u2019s alpha value of .876. These findings affirm the dependability of the measurement\ninstruments, suggesting that the items within each construct consistently capture the intended\nconcepts. Overall, the study's measurement instruments demonstrate satisfactory to excellent\nreliability, instilling confidence in the accuracy and consistency of the data collected for the\ninvestigation.\n4.

Correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed).\nThe results of the correlation study, as shown in Table 6, indicate statistically significant\nassociations among the variables being examined, namely \"Supplier Collaboration,\" \"Supplier\nDevelopment,\" \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection,\" \"Long Term Supplier Relationships,\" and \"Cost\nEfficiency.\" The quantification of these interactions is accomplished by use Pearson correlation\ncoefficients, all of which exhibit statistical significance at the 0.01 level (two-tailed), so suggesting\nrobust associations.\nThe dimension of \"Supplier Collaboration\" demonstrates a notably strong positive correlation\nof 88.9% with the dimension of \"Supplier Development,\" indicating a solid and significant\nassociation between these two aspects of managing supplier relationships. Furthermore, the\nconcept of \"Supplier Collaboration\" exhibits a significant positive correlation of 85.6% with\n\"Supplier Evaluation and Selection,\" underscoring the robustness of the association between these\ntwo factors. The concept of \"Supplier Development\" exhibits a notably robust positive correlation\nof 88.5% with \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection,\" hence emphasizing their significant alignment.\nMoreover, there exists a strong positive correlation of 80.1% between the construct of \"Supplier\nDevelopment\" and the construct of \"Long Term Supplier Relationships,\" highlighting the significant\ninterdependence of both variables. The variable \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection\" demonstrates\na significant positive correlation of 79.2% with the variable \"Long Term Supplier Relationships,\"\nindicating a robust link between the two. There exists a positive association between \"Cost\nEfficiency\" and all elements of supplier relationship management, as evidenced by the Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients. It is worth noting that the variable \"Cost Efficiency\" exhibits a substantial\npositive correlation of 72.8% with the variable \"Supplier Collaboration,\" a positive correlation of\n70.2% with \"Supplier Development,\" a positive correlation of 68.5% with \"Supplier Evaluation and\nSelection,\" and a notably high positive correlation of 78.2% with \"Long Term Supplier\nRelationships.\" In summary, the aforementioned data suggest that when supplier management\ntechniques adopt a more collaborative approach, prioritize development, incorporate evaluation\nmeasures, and aim to cultivate long-term partnerships, there is a notable enhancement in \"Cost\nEfficiency.\" The percentages presented in the data indicate the magnitude and orientation of these\nconnections, underscoring the noteworthy influence of proficient supplier relationship\nmanagement on cost effectiveness, a critical facet of organizational efficacy.\n5.2 Regression Analysis\nTable 4 - Model Summary\nModel R\nR\nSquare\nAdjusted\nR\nSquare\nStd.\nError of\nthe\nEstimate\nChange Statistics\nR\nSquare\nChange\nF\nChange\ndf1 df2\nSig.

Predictors: (Constant), Long Term Supplier Relationships, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, Supplier\nCollaboration, Supplier Development\nThe Model Summary table presents a detailed overview of the regression analysis performed in\nthis study, providing insights into the performance and importance of the model. The table\npresents a strong positive linear association between the dependent variable (not specified in the\ntable) and a group of independent variables, including SRM practices such as Supplier\nCollaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, and Long-Term Supplier\nRelationships, as indicated by an R-value of .801. The considerable R-value highlights the model's\ncapacity to elucidate fluctuations in the dependent variable. The coefficient of determination,\nrepresented by the symbol R\u00b2, is seen to be 0.642. This implies that around 64.2% of the variability\nobserved in the dependent variable may be ascribed to the impact of the SRM practices used in the\nmodel. The observed R\u00b2 value indicates that the set of SRM practices under consideration make a\nsubstantial contribution towards explaining the variability observed in the dependent variable.\nAdditionally, the adjusted R\u00b2, which accounts for the number of predictors in the model,\ndemonstrates a robust value of .637. The revised number suggests that, even after accounting for\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n10/18\nthe potential danger of overfitting, the model is capable of efficiently elucidating around 63.7% of\nthe variability observed in the dependent variable. The standard error of the estimate, which\nrepresents the mean variation between projected and actual values, is calculated to be .69525. This\nmetric offers a measure of the model's accuracy in forecasting the values of the dependent variable.\nThe change statistics section provides evidence of a significant enhancement in the model's fit\nwhen using the SRM practices as predictors. The F-statistic, which has a value of 118.993, along with\na p-value of .000 that is highly significant, provides confirmation of the overall relevance of the\nmodel incorporating these predictors. The aforementioned observation highlights the significance\nand pertinence of the Strategic Risk Management (SRM) techniques when elucidating the\nfluctuations observed in the dependent variable. In summary, the Model Summary table indicates\nthat the regression model, which includes SRM practices as predictors, is statistically significant and\nhas a strong ability to account for a significant portion of the variability in the dependent variable.\nThis underscores the importance of these practices in the context of the study.\nTable 5 - ANOVAa\nModel Sum of\nSquares\ndf Mean\nSquare\nF Sig.\n1 Regression 230.073 4 57.518 118.993 .000b\nResidual 128.094 265 .483\nTotal 358.167 269\na.

In the Regression\nsection, the calculation of the sum of squares is performed to evaluate the amount of variance\naccounted for by the model. The resulting value is determined to be 230.073, with a corresponding\n4 degrees of freedom (df). The mean square value that corresponds to the given data is 57.518. In\ncontrast, the Residual part pertains to the unexplained variance and presents a sum of squares\nequal to 128.094, which is accompanied by 265 degrees of freedom. The Total Sum of Squares (TSS),\nwhich measures the total variance in \"Cost Efficiency,\" is calculated to be 358.167.\nThe F-statistic, a crucial metric, is computed as 118.993 by dividing the mean square for the\nregression by the mean square for the residual. This statistical measure evaluates the overall\nsignificance of the regression model. The p-value, shown as \"Sig.,\" is significantly small (p = .000).\nThe obtained p-value, which is remarkably low, provides strong evidence that the regression model,\nencompassing Long-Term Supplier Relationships, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, Supplier\nCollaboration, and Supplier Development as predictor variables, is highly significant in elucidating\nthe fluctuations observed in \"Cost Efficiency.\" In more accessible language, these predictor\nvariables together considerably improve the model's capacity to explain the differences found in\n\"Cost Efficiency.\" Therefore, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) findings offer strong statistical\nsupport for the model's ability to effectively elucidate and forecast cost efficiency within the\nframework of supplier relationship management procedures.\nTable 6 - Coefficients\nModel Unstandardized\nCoefficients\nStandardized\nCoefficients\nt Sig.\nB Std.

The observed phenomenon exhibits an\nunstandardized coefficient (B) of -0.303, accompanied by a standard error of 0.270. The t-statistic\nassociated with the given data is -1.121, resulting in a p-value of 0.263. This p-value is above the\ncommonly accepted significance level of 0.05. Therefore, it may be concluded that the constant\nterm does not possess statistical significance in its ability to explain the fluctuations observed in\n\"Cost Efficiency.\" Shifting our focus towards the independent factors, the variable \"Supplier\nCollaboration\" holds considerable importance.

The predictor\nexhibits a t-statistic of 3.146, accompanied by a p-value of 0.002, indicating a significant and positive\ninfluence on the variable \"Cost Efficiency.\" More precisely, there is a positive correlation between a\none-unit increase in supplier collaboration and a 0.342-unit improvement in \"Cost Efficiency.\" On\nthe other hand, the variable \"Supplier Development\" demonstrates a coefficient (B) of 0.027, which\nlacks standardization, accompanied with a standard error of 0.114. Nevertheless, the standardized\ncoefficient (Beta) for this variable is only 0.022, indicating a minimal impact. The t-statistic for the\npredictor variable is calculated to be 0.233, with a corresponding p-value of 0.816. This p-value\nexceeds the commonly accepted significance level of 0.05. Therefore, the variable \"Supplier\nDevelopment\" does not exhibit a statistically significant impact on the variable \"Cost Efficiency.\"\nSimilarly, the variable \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection\" is found to have an unstandardized\ncoefficient (B) of -0.007, with a corresponding standard error of 0.118. The standardized coefficient\n(Beta) has a value of -0.005. The t-statistic for the predictor in question is -0.058, and its\ncorresponding p-value is 0.954, both of which are significantly beyond the conventional threshold\nfor statistical significance. Therefore, the variable \"Supplier Evaluation and Selection\" does not\ndemonstrate a statistically significant influence on the variable \"Cost Efficiency.\" Finally, the variable\n\"Long Term Supplier Relationships\" appears as a significantly influential predictor. The\nunstandardized coefficient (B) is reported as 0.681, accompanied by a standard error of 0.082.\nAdditionally, the standardized coefficient (Beta) is reported as 0.550, indicating a significant effect.\nThe t-statistic for the predictor variable exhibits robustness, measuring 8.332. The related p-value\nis 0.000, indicating a significant and positive impact on the variable \"Cost Efficiency.\" Specifically, an\nincrease of one unit in long-term supplier connections is associated with a significant rise of 0.681\nunits in \"Cost Efficiency.\" In summary, the variables of \"Supplier Collaboration\" and \"Long Term\nSupplier Relationships\" demonstrate statistically significant relationships with positive impacts on\n\"Cost Efficiency.\" However, the variables of \"Supplier Development\" and \"Supplier Evaluation and\nSelection\" do not exhibit such statistical significance in explaining variations in the dependent\nvariable.\n5. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS OF FINDINGS\nThe study's findings provide useful insights into the connections between SRM practices and\nsupply chain performance, with a specific emphasis on cost efficiency. This analysis is conducted\nwithin the specific context of Bangladesh's industrial and service industries. The correlation study\ndemonstrates statistically significant relationships among the variables under investigation,\nemphasizing the strong linkages between Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier\nEvaluation and Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships, and Cost Efficiency. The presence of\npositive correlations suggests that the successful execution of SRM procedures has a key role in\nattaining cost-effectiveness in supply chain operations. The robust positive association between\nSupplier Collaboration and Supplier Development highlights the interdependence of both SRM\ncharacteristics. Organizations that participate in cooperative efforts and allocate resources to\nincrease the competencies of their suppliers are likely to achieve a synergistic outcome, resulting\nin enhanced cost effectiveness (Feizabadi & Alibakhshi, 2022; Shafiq et al., 2022; Uddin et al., 2020).\nFurthermore, the strong correlation between Supplier Collaboration and Supplier Evaluation and\nSelection underscores the significance of thorough evaluation and collaboration. This implies that\norganizations that prioritize both aspects simultaneously are more likely to achieve efficient and\neconomical supply chain operations. The strong positive association between Supplier\nDevelopment and Supplier Evaluation and Selection highlights the consistency between both\nprocedures. Organizations that allocate resources to supplier development projects are also prone\nto having clearly defined assessment and choice procedures, which in turn lead to improved cost\neffectiveness. Furthermore, the robust positive link between Supplier Development and Long-Term\nSupplier Relationships underscores the strategic interconnectedness of both aspects.\nOrganizations that prioritize the development of their suppliers are more likely to establish long\u0002lasting partnerships, which in turn leads to sustainable cost efficiency in the long run (Lahti et al.,\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n12/18\n2018; Larsson & Larsson, 2020; Prosser et al., 2021; Wren, 2022). The correlation between Long\u0002Term Supplier Relationships and Supplier Evaluation and Selection indicates that firms that\nmaintain long-term partnerships with important suppliers also place a high emphasis on thorough\nevaluation and selection procedures. This emphasizes the need of stability and trust in supplier\nrelationships for attaining cost-efficient supply chain operations. The regression analysis enhances\nthese insights by offering a comprehensive model summary. The model, which incorporates\nSupplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, and Long-Term\nSupplier Relationships as predictors, shows statistical significance in explaining the observed\nheterogeneity in Cost Efficiency. The high R-value and coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) suggest that\napproximately 64.2% of the variation in cost efficiency may be attributable to the influence of the\nSRM practices included in the model. The corrected R\u00b2, which takes into consideration the number\nof predictors, remains strong at 63.7%, confirming the model's effectiveness in explaining variability\nwithout overfitting. The substantial F-statistic in the ANOVA table provides additional confirmation\nof the model's overall significance, highlighting the combined influence of the predictor variables\non Cost Efficiency. The coefficients analysis offers comprehensive insights into the specific effects\nof each predictor variable. Supplier Collaboration and Long-Term Supplier Relationships are\nidentified as statistically significant factors that have a beneficial impact on Cost Efficiency.\nNevertheless, the effects of Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection on Cost\nEfficiency are not statistically significant.\nThe study's findings through the empirical results hold substantial implications for\norganizations in Bangladesh's manufacturing and service sectors, offering precise guidance on\noptimizing supply chain performance, particularly in terms of cost efficiency. The strong positive\nconnections observed between Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier Evaluation\nand Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships, and Cost Efficiency highlight the\ninterconnectedness of various aspects under SRM. Businesses must recognize the need of\nimplementing a thorough and unified approach to SRM processes to enhance cost efficiency in\ntheir supply chain operations. The importance of Supplier Collaboration and Long-Term Supplier\nRelationships in terms of strategic significance becomes evident as a crucial lesson. Organizations\nthat prioritize collaborating with suppliers and fostering long-lasting partnerships are well\u0002positioned to achieve ongoing cost reduction (Allioui & Mourdi, 2023). This highlights a change in\nviewpoint, encouraging businesses to see suppliers not only as transactional entities but as\nstrategic partners, cultivating enduring relationships that greatly contribute to the overall success\nof the supply chain. The correlation between Supplier Collaboration and Supplier Development\nimplies a mutually beneficial result when firms collaborate and invest in improving supplier skills.\nThis is consistent with the current body of research on collaborative supply chain methods and\ntheir influence on operational efficiency and cost reduction (Benton Jr et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2021;\nLo et al., 2018). Moreover, it is important to strengthen the argument of the significant association\nbetween Supplier Development and Long-Term Supplier Relationships by referencing research that\nemphasize the strategic interdependence of these factors. Empirical evidence demonstrating the\nenduring advantages of supplier development activities on fostering durable partnerships and\nenhancing cost efficiency would strengthen the claim (Cocskun et al., 2022; Faruquee et al., 2021;\nJia et al., 2023; Manuela et al., 2021; Rezaei Vandchali et al., 2020). Supplier Development remains\ncrucial in SRM, but its effect on cost efficiency depends on the presence of complementary\nstrategies, as indicated by the study. The integration of supplier development programs with\nrigorous supplier evaluation and selection processes is crucial. Organizations should prioritize not\nonly improving supplier competencies, but also conducting thorough evaluations and choosing\nsuppliers based on their performance, quality, and risk management. The strong correlation\nbetween Long-Term Supplier Relationships and Supplier Evaluation and Selection emphasizes the\nsignificance of stability and confidence in supplier connections. Organizations that establish long\u0002term cooperation with important suppliers are more inclined to prioritize comprehensive review\nand selection procedures, resulting in streamlined supply chain operations (Tay & Aw, 2021).\nTherefore, it may be inferred that making efforts in establishing and sustaining long-lasting\nrelationships with suppliers can result in a series of beneficial outcomes for many aspects of supply\nchain performance, such as improved cost effectiveness. Having highlighted in the above\ndiscussions, it is worth mentioning here that these discoveries provide practical and implementable\nknowledge for sustaining supply chain operations in Bangladesh. Emphasizing cooperative\nmethods, fostering enduring partnerships with crucial suppliers, and executing rigorous\nassessments of suppliers can greatly contribute to achieving cost effectiveness. The study suggests\nprospective areas for further research, promoting a thorough investigation of certain methods\nwithin Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection. Furthermore, conducting\ninquiries into industry-specific variables that impact these connections within the distinct setting of\nBangladesh could yield useful insights. In summary, the study provides accurate and useful advice\nfor firms dealing with the complex field of supply chain management in Bangladesh.\nQuantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing\nand service sectors\nBrazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi.org/10.14488/BJOPM.2015.2024\n13/18\n6 CONCLUSION\nThe study intended to investigate the function of SRM in the changing economic environment\nof Bangladesh, specifically focusing on its influence on supply chain performance. During the\ninvestigation, it became evident that SRM methods have a beneficial impact on different aspects of\nthe supply chain, notably in relation to cost effectiveness. The results highlight the crucial\nsignificance of Supplier Collaboration and the establishment of enduring Supplier Relationships.\nThe study found strong positive associations, highlighting the interconnectedness of several\ncomponents of SRM. Organizations that actively collaborate and develop long-lasting partnerships\nwith suppliers are more likely to achieve sustained cost effectiveness in their supply chain\noperations. In contrast, the individual effects of Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and\nSelection on cost efficiency were not statistically significant. This suggests that the efficacy of these\nactivities may depend on the presence of complementary tactics or an integrated strategy. The\nstudy promotes a comprehensive comprehension of SRM, going beyond individual practices, in\norder to fully use its potential in the context of Bangladesh. The research findings offer useful\ninsights for professionals and policymakers in the manufacturing and service sectors of\nBangladesh. They emphasize the significance of implementing a thorough SRM strategy, regarding\nsuppliers as strategic allies, and cultivating lasting partnerships for sustained success in the supply\nchain. The study's practical implications provide valuable counsel for firms aiming to improve their\nsupply chain performance, specifically in terms of cost effectiveness. Notwithstanding the\ncontributions offered, it is imperative to recognize the limitations of the study. The findings may\nhave limited generalizability due to the emphasis on certain sectors and the presence of\noperational complexity. Potential areas for future research involve investigating industry-specific\nvariables that impact the success of SRM in Bangladesh, as well as conducting in-depth analysis of\npractices within Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection. The study establishes\na base for continued investigation of SRM in developing countries, with the goal of gaining a more\ndetailed comprehension of its intricacies and potential advantages.\nREFERENCES\nAbbas, H. & Tong, S.

It involves developing dynamic partnerships between businesses and their suppliers (Sharma et al., 2020). SRM focuses on creating lasting and mutually beneficial relationships beyond mere transactions (Enz & Lambert, 2023). In today's competitive landscape, strong supplier relationships are vital for success (Amoako-Gyampah et al., 2019). SRM goes beyond..",
      "s8: ..transactions, encompassing strategic collaboration, innovation, and value generation (Pereira et al., 2022). This review examines SRM's impact on supply chain performance, including cost efficiency, product quality, on-time delivery, and customer satisfaction. SRM has evolved from transactional interactions to strategic alliances (Abbas & Tong, 2023). Recognizing suppliers as essential partners shifted the focus to collaboration and long-term partnerships. Technological advancements improved SRM's efficiency, with digital platforms enhancing communication (Emon & Nahid, 2023; Tseng, 2020). Strong relationships with suppliers stimulate innovation and value creation (Lee & Tang, 2018). SRM now encompasses collaborative partnerships, risk management, supplier development, and sustainability (Emon & Khan, 2023; Huma et al., 2020). Empirical studies show that proficient SRM positively impacts supplier performance, cost-effectiveness, product quality, and delivery punctuality (Le Jr, 2022). Collaboration, information exchange, and trust development are key foundations of successful SRM (Cha & Kim, 2018). Supplier development activities enhance supplier performance (Mani et al., 2018). 2.2 Supplier Collaboration and Supply Chain Performance: SRM highlights the importance of strategic collaboration as a fundamental element for achieving success in the current dynamic and competitive supply chain environment..",

There is a large body of literature that strongly supports the notion that successful collaboration with suppliers plays a crucial role in improving the performance of the supply chain. This section examines the current studies on how supplier collaboration affects several aspects of supply chain performance and builds upon the literature presented by Oduro et al., (2020). Collaborative relationships in SRM go beyond standard transactional methods and play a crucial role in promoting innovation, enhancing product quality, assuring timely delivery, and ultimately improving customer happiness (Abtahi et al., 2023; Stek & Schiele, 2021). The development of SRM has experienced a significant change from transactional interactions to the formation of strategic partnerships, emphasizing the crucial role of collaboration in creating and sustaining long-term relationships with suppliers (Yang, 2022). The growing interdependence and global integration of supply chains has underscored the importance of strong collaborative methods. Technological improvements are crucial in enabling and enhancing collaborative efforts in SRM. Digital platforms have become crucial instruments that not only facilitate communication but also improve the sharing of information between organizations and their suppliers (Ebinger & Omondi, 2020). These platforms facilitate instantaneous data exchange, which is essential for efficient collaboration, especially in a multinational supply chain setting where prompt information is..",

Supplier development goes beyond conventional transactional methods and encompasses a range of actions aimed at improving the talents and performance of suppliers (Awan et al., 2019). Activities may encompass training programs, streamlining processes, embracing technology, and engaging in collaborative projects with the goal of promoting innovation and ongoing enhancement. According to the literature, supplier development programs that are successful contribute to better supplier performance, which in turn leads to cost-effectiveness and increased efficiency in the supply chain (Asif et al., 2022). Although the current body of literature offers significant insights into the favorable relationship between supplier development and supply chain performance, there are still intricacies and unique mechanisms that warrant further investigation. Gaining insight into the impact of different elements of supplier development on various facets of supply chain performance is essential for formulating focused and efficient strategies. This section seeks to highlight any existing gaps in the current knowledge and clarify how the present study helps to filling these gaps by offering a detailed perspective on the complex connection between supplier development activities and the overall performance of the supply chain. 2.4 Supplier Evaluation and Supply Chain Performance: Effective SRM relies on the use of strong supplier assessment methods, which are essential for achieving optimal..",

This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the current research on the complex connection between supplier evaluation and the overall performance of the supply chain. It expands on the fundamental findings presented by Amoako-Gyampah et al., (2019). Supplier evaluation in the context of SRM entails a thorough examination of supplier performance, cost efficiency, product quality, and delivery timeliness (Lim et al., 2021). Proficient SRM has been found to have a favorable impact on supplier evaluation, leading to improvements in several aspects of supply chain performance, as indicated by the existing literature. However, there may be gaps in our present understanding of how the precise criteria used in supplier assessment processes are closely connected to various aspects of supply chain performance. The purpose of this section is to identify and explain the gaps in the current knowledge, by conducting a detailed analysis of the relationship between different criteria used to evaluate suppliers and various aspects of supply chain performance. Through this approach, it aims to enhance and improve the theoretical foundation that supports the connection between supplier evaluation methods and the overall efficacy of the supply chain. 2.5 Long-Term Supplier Relationship and Supply Chain Performance: Long..",

This part provides a thorough examination of the current research, exploring the complex connection between long-term relationships with suppliers and the various factors that affect supply chain effectiveness. The fundamental knowledge presented by Shakeel et al., (2018) acts as a crucial basis for this investigation. Organizations have recognized the importance of suppliers as crucial partners and have therefore made it a strategic priority to develop long-term relationships. This involves focusing on collaboration and mutual benefits under the SRM framework (Kannan, 2018). Empirical research confirm that long-term supplier relationships have a beneficial effect on different measures of supply chain performance. However, there may be gaps in our current understanding regarding the detailed mechanisms by which these linkages contribute to the complex fabric of supply chain performance. This section aims to thoroughly identify any potential gaps in the current literature, with the goal of clarifying how the present study enhances the understanding of the relationship between long-term supplier relationships and various aspects of supply chain performance.

This section aims to add to both theoretical refinement and practical insights for businesses managing long-term supplier relationships within the broader framework of SRM. 2.6 Theoretical Frameworks in SRM Understanding Supplier Relationship Management's (SRM) theoretical foundations and evolution is essential to grasp its dynamics. Originally transactional, SRM has evolved into a strategic approach focusing on long-term value (Dash et al., 2018). Theoretical dimensions include transaction cost minimization, resource leverage, incentive alignment, and risk management (Rejeb et al., 2021). The evolution of Transaction Cost Economics (TCE), Resource-Based View (RBV), and Agency Theory has mirrored SRM's transformation. Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) emphasizes minimizing transaction costs in SRM (Swallehe, 2021). Resource-Based View (RBV) highlights supplier relationships as sources of competitive advantage (Andersen, 2021). Agency Theory addresses agency issues within supplier relationships (Dubey..",
      "s15: ..et al., 2019). These theories intersect in SRM to reduce costs, leverage resources, align incentives, and manage risks (Gilmore & Buhaug, 2021). Depending upon the theoretical underpinnings elucidated in the comprehensive examination of existing literature, the present section delineates the conceptual framework that will guide the investigation. The theoretical framework selected for this study is the Resource-Based View (RBV), which asserts that businesses can attain enduring competitive advantage via the strategic utilization of distinctive resources and skills. across the scope of this study, the Resource-Based View (RBV) framework offers a perspective that enables the examination of how SRM methods impact a particular outcome variable, namely cost efficiency, across supply chains operating in Bangladesh. The Resource-Based View (RBV) theory places significant emphasis on the significance of supplier relationships as important sources of resources and capabilities that ultimately promote cost effectiveness within supply chains. The resources and capabilities obtained through SRM techniques are anticipated to have a favorable impact on cost efficiency. This is demonstrated by the potential to attain cost reductions, cost savings, and cost-effectiveness in supply chain activities. 2.7 Research Hypotheses & Conceptual Framework Supplier collaboration: The implementation of supplier collaboration, which involves engaging in cooperative activities and sharing knowledge with suppliers, has been demonstrated..",

MATERIAL AND METHODS The research design employed for this study is quantitative, aiming to comprehensively investigate the relationship between SRM practices and cost efficiency in the supply chains of firms operating in Bangladesh. The study focuses on one main category of variables: independent variables representing SRM practices and one dependent variable representing cost efficiency. In terms of independent variables, the study encompasses four dimensions of SRM practices. Supplier Collaboration, the variable in question quantifies the extent of collaboration and information exchange between enterprises and their suppliers. This statement elucidates the degree to which firms partake in collaborative endeavors and exchange information with suppliers in order to enhance cost effectiveness within their supply chains (Tai et al., 2022). Supplier Development, this variable evaluates the endeavors undertaken by enterprises to enhance the capabilities and resources of their suppliers. The initiatives encompass many strategies, such as training programs, technology transfer endeavors, and collaborative projects focused on enhancing process efficiency with the goal of attaining cost effectiveness (Gu et al., 2021). Supplier Evaluation and Selection, this variable investigates the criteria and procedures employed by firms to assess, choose, and oversee their suppliers. The concept incorporates various elements such as assessments of supplier performance, evaluations..",
      "s21: ..of quality, and procedures related to risk management, all of which have an impact on cost efficiency (Dobos & V\u00f6r\u00f6smarty, 2019). Long-Term Supplier Relationships, this characteristic pertains to the temporal extent and steadfastness of the associations established between organizations and their suppliers. The metric assesses the degree to which firms sustain enduring collaborations with crucial suppliers, which can have a lasting impact on cost effectiveness (Mohan et al., 2021). The dependent variable, Cost Efficiency, the dependent variable in question measures the degree of cost-effectiveness exhibited by supply chain operations. The measurements encompassed in this category consist of cost reduction, cost savings, and supply chain cost-to-revenue ratios (Panfilova et al., 2020). The study's setting was Bangladesh, with a specific focus on organizations in various sectors, including manufacturing and services. The study involved a Convenience sampling technique to ensure representation from both manufacturing and service sectors. Data were collected from multiple departments or individuals responsible for SRM and supply chain operations within each firm, such as procurement, supply chain management, and strategic management. The participants, selected based on their roles and responsibilities related to SRM practices, included managers, procurement officers, and individuals involved in supply chain decision-making processes. A sample size..",
      "s22: ..of 270 individuals was determined to strike a balance between practicality and the requirement for statistical significance, considering the constraints of convenience sampling. Data were collected through a structured survey instrument consisting of 22 items, representing independent and dependent variables. The Likert scale was used to measure responses, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The survey instrument was developed based on a thorough review of existing literature and validated scales used in previous studies. Quantitative techniques, including regression analysis and correlation analysis, were applied for data analysis using SPSS 22 to assess the relationships between SRM practices and cost efficiency. These statistical methods aimed to provide insights into the extent to which SRM practices influenced cost efficiency in the context of Bangladeshi firms.

Furthermore, the strong correlation between Supplier Collaboration and Supplier Evaluation and Selection underscores the significance of thorough evaluation and collaboration. This implies that organizations that prioritize both aspects simultaneously are more likely to achieve efficient and economical supply chain operations. The strong positive association between Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection highlights the consistency between both procedures. Organizations that allocate resources to supplier development projects are also prone to having clearly defined assessment and choice procedures, which in turn lead to improved cost effectiveness. Furthermore, the robust positive link between Supplier Development and Long-Term Supplier Relationships underscores the strategic interconnectedness of both aspects. Organizations that prioritize the development of their suppliers are more likely to establish longlasting partnerships, which in turn leads to sustainable cost efficiency in the long run (Lahti et al., Quantifying the influence of supplier relationship management and supply chain performance: an investigation of Bangladesh\u2019s manufacturing and service sectors Brazilian Journal of Operations and Production Management, Vol. 21, No. 2 e20242015| https://doi...",

The correlation between LongTerm Supplier Relationships and Supplier Evaluation and Selection indicates that firms that maintain long-term partnerships with important suppliers also place a high emphasis on thorough evaluation and selection procedures. This emphasizes the need of stability and trust in supplier relationships for attaining cost-efficient supply chain operations. The regression analysis enhances these insights by offering a comprehensive model summary. The model, which incorporates Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, and Long-Term Supplier Relationships as predictors, shows statistical significance in explaining the observed heterogeneity in Cost Efficiency. The high R-value and coefficient of determination (R2) suggest that approximately 64.2% of the variation in cost efficiency may be attributable to the influence of the SRM practices included in the model. The corrected R2, which takes into consideration the number of predictors, remains strong at 63.7%, confirming the model's effectiveness in explaining variability without overfitting. The substantial F-statistic in the ANOVA table provides additional confirmation of the model's overall significance, highlighting the combined influence of the predictor variables on Cost Efficiency. The coefficients analysis offers..",

Supplier Collaboration and Long-Term Supplier Relationships are identified as statistically significant factors that have a beneficial impact on Cost Efficiency. Nevertheless, the effects of Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection on Cost Efficiency are not statistically significant. The study's findings through the empirical results hold substantial implications for organizations in Bangladesh's manufacturing and service sectors, offering precise guidance on optimizing supply chain performance, particularly in terms of cost efficiency. The strong positive connections observed between Supplier Collaboration, Supplier Development, Supplier Evaluation and Selection, Long-Term Supplier Relationships, and Cost Efficiency highlight the interconnectedness of various aspects under SRM. Businesses must recognize the need of implementing a thorough and unified approach to SRM processes to enhance cost efficiency in their supply chain operations. The importance of Supplier Collaboration and Long-Term Supplier Relationships in terms of strategic significance becomes evident as a crucial lesson. Organizations that prioritize collaborating with suppliers and fostering long-lasting partnerships are wellpositioned to achieve ongoing cost reduction (Allioui & Mourdi, 2023). This highlights a change in viewpoint, encouraging businesses to see suppliers not only as transactional entities but as strategic partners, cultivating enduring relationships that greatly contribute to the overall success of the supply chain.

This is consistent with the current body of research on collaborative supply chain methods and their influence on operational efficiency and cost reduction (Benton Jr et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2021; Lo et al., 2018). Moreover, it is important to strengthen the argument of the significant association between Supplier Development and Long-Term Supplier Relationships by referencing research that emphasize the strategic interdependence of these factors. Empirical evidence demonstrating the enduring advantages of supplier development activities on fostering durable partnerships and enhancing cost efficiency would strengthen the claim (Cocskun et al., 2022; Faruquee et al., 2021; Jia et al., 2023; Manuela et al., 2021; Rezaei Vandchali et al., 2020). Supplier Development remains crucial in SRM, but its effect on cost efficiency depends on the presence of complementary strategies, as indicated by the study. The integration of supplier development programs with rigorous supplier evaluation and selection processes is crucial. Organizations should prioritize not only improving supplier competencies, but also conducting thorough evaluations and choosing suppliers based on their performance, quality, and risk management.

Organizations that establish longterm cooperation with important suppliers are more inclined to prioritize comprehensive review and selection procedures, resulting in streamlined supply chain operations (Tay & Aw, 2021). Therefore, it may be inferred that making efforts in establishing and sustaining long-lasting relationships with suppliers can result in a series of beneficial outcomes for many aspects of supply chain performance, such as improved cost effectiveness. Having highlighted in the above discussions, it is worth mentioning here that these discoveries provide practical and implementable knowledge for sustaining supply chain operations in Bangladesh. Emphasizing cooperative methods, fostering enduring partnerships with crucial suppliers, and executing rigorous assessments of suppliers can greatly contribute to achieving cost effectiveness. The study suggests prospective areas for further research, promoting a thorough investigation of certain methods within Supplier Development and Supplier Evaluation and Selection. Furthermore, conducting inquiries into industry-specific variables that impact these connections within the distinct setting of Bangladesh could yield useful insights.

    "report_generated": "# Supplier Relationship Management and Supply Chain Performance\n\n## Introduction\nSupplier Relationship Management (SRM) is a critical component of modern supply chain management, focusing on developing dynamic partnerships between businesses and their suppliers\u3010s7\u3011. In today's competitive landscape, strong supplier relationships are vital for success, encompassing strategic collaboration, innovation, and value generation\u3010s8\u3011.\n\n## Literature Review\n### SRM and Supply Chain Performance\nNumerous studies have highlighted the positive influence of proficient SRM strategies on various aspects of supply chain performance, including supplier performance, cost effectiveness, product quality, and delivery punctuality\u3010s3\u3011\u3010s4\u3011. Research conducted in industrialized countries such as the United States and Germany has emphasized the favorable impact of SRM on these performance metrics\u3010s4\u3011.\n\n### Supplier Collaboration\nSuccessful collaboration with suppliers plays a crucial role in improving supply chain performance. Collaborative relationships go beyond standard transactional methods, promoting innovation, enhancing product quality, and ensuring timely delivery\u3010s9\u3011. Technological advancements have further enabled and enhanced collaborative efforts in SRM\u3010s10\u3011.\n\n### Supplier Development\nSupplier development activities are key elements in SRM, aimed at improving supplier performance and overall supply chain efficiency\u3010s11\u3011. These activities include training programs, process streamlining, and technology adoption, contributing to cost-effectiveness and increased efficiency\u3010s11\u3011.\n\n### Supplier Evaluation and Selection\nEffective supplier evaluation and selection methods are essential for achieving optimal supply chain efficiency\u3010s12\u3011. Proficient SRM positively impacts supplier evaluation, leading to improvements in cost efficiency, product quality, and delivery timeliness\u3010s12\u3011.\n\n### Long-Term Supplier Relationships\nLong-term supplier connections exert substantial impact on supply chain performance\u3010s13\u3011. Organizations have recognized the importance of developing long-term relationships with suppliers, focusing on collaboration and mutual benefits\u3010s13\u3011.\n\n## Discussion\nThe synthesis of existing literature demonstrates that SRM practices significantly influence supply chain performance. The strong positive correlations between SRM components such as supplier collaboration, development, evaluation, and long-term relationships highlight their interconnectedness\u3010s24\u3011\u3010s25\u3011. These findings suggest that a comprehensive and integrated approach to SRM can enhance cost efficiency in supply chain operations\u3010s26\u3011.\n\n## Conclusion\nBased on the synthesis of existing literature, it can be hypothesized that implementing a holistic SRM strategy, which includes supplier collaboration, development, evaluation, and long-term relationships, will lead to improved cost efficiency in supply chains\u3010s29\u3011\u3010s30\u3011. This hypothesis provides a foundation for further research and practical application in emerging economies like Bangladesh\u3010s40\u3011."
