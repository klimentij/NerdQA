In recent years, from the majority of field experiences, it has been learned that communications networks are one of the major pillars for disaster management. In this regard, the exploitation of different space technology applications to support the communications services in disasters plays an important role, in the prevention and mitigation of the natural disasters effects on terrestrial communications infrastructures. Likewise, to design the network, different technical and operational specifications are considered; among which are: the emergency operational strategies implementation to maneuver remote sensing satellites on orbit for optimal images capture and processing, as well as the payload and radio frequencies characterization in communications satellites to implement communications technology tools useful for disaster management. Therefore, this emergency communications network allows putting in operation diverse communications infrastructures for data and images exchange, making available the essential information to accomplish a fast response in disasters or to facilitate the communications infrastructures recuperation in emergencies situations. It is also a technology that has the ability to provide valuable information to assist in all the disaster management phases. From this perspective, the integration of the remote sensing satellites and communications satellites in a novel and practical topology with the purpose of implementing an emergency communications network to manage disaster events represents an important and necessary resource to enhance the abilities to monitor, manage, and control the critical data flow associated with the occurrence of one or more disasters in a specific region. Operational schemes that provide the capabilities to put into operation services or technology solutions are as follows: Communications architectures for disaster warning/management, radio and TV broadcasting services by satellite, cellular phone services over satellite, video conference services, very small aperture terminal (VSAT) networks, broadband satellite Internet services, and distinct architectures to images exchange, among other technology resources useful in the disaster management field. ...

As satellite-based systems are less susceptible to ground-based disasters, satellite-based communication channels often remain operational when terrestrial networks are compromised. Satellite communications are also integral to efforts to predict when a natural disaster might strike – especially in disaster-prone areas that experience the worse effects of adverse weather and climate change. Emergency management agencies can use satellite communications to not only detect and monitor any incoming threats, such as hurricanes and tsunamis, but also to deliver public service announcements, safety guidelines and information about evacuation routes and shelter locations to help individuals stay informed and prepared to respond effectively to any given crisis, minimising panic and confusion. Satellite communications not only play a crucial role in facilitating real-time communication and coordination during emergencies but also in assessing the damage and supporting recovery efforts after a disaster. By leveraging satellite technology, responders gain valuable insights into the level of destruction and strategise recovery plans accordingly. Satellite communications play a multifaceted role in disaster management, not only supporting real-time communication and coordination during emergencies but also assisting in the assessment of damage and facilitating the recovery process. By leveraging satellite technology, responders can gather crucial data on structural damage, environmental conditions and project progress.

Globalization, the end of the Cold War and increased involvement of non-state actors in global affairs represent fundamentally shifting relations of power, speeding up national economies’ integration and contributing to the convergence of policies in different issue domains. This review considers the state of global governance by presenting a variety of global governance arrangements, key challenges facing governance in an increasingly globalized context and possibilities for the future governance. Humanities and Social Sciences Communications - Global governance: present and future Abbott and Snidal (2010) use the term “Transnational New Governance” to recognize the way IGOs expand capacity and access to resources by including private and non-governmental actors and institutions. This formulates global collaborative networks in which IGOs shape and support the operations of NGOs and certain private enterprises. Human security provides an excellent compatible conceptual paradigm to global governance regimes in the future, which must respond to transnational, multi-dimensional threats that a single country cannot manage. For example, a number of national security analysts have already begun to recognize environmental degradation and natural disasters such as epidemics, floods, earthquakes, poverty and droughts as national security threats similar to military disasters (King and Murray, 2001–2002).<br><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201545" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/palcomms201545</a></li><li id="tree-E4999258521"><strong>E4999258521:</strong> Abbott and Snidal (2010) use the term “Transnational New Governance” to recognize the way IGOs expand capacity and access to resources by including private and non-governmental actors and institutions.

There are far more actors involved in DRM activities today than a decade ago [39]. Using SNA metrics, researchers can distinguish who the significant actors are, how they embed in the network, and what relational advantages allow them to direct, organize, and regulate social activities [108]. Under this agenda a reduced role for the state has emerged and an opening of the governing arena to a wider multitude of nonstate actors. This chapter discusses three dimensions to the changing distribution of influence and responsibility in disaster risk governance. The first is the “upward” dimension, wherein governments are becoming more accountable to global institutions. It particularly examines (i) the processes that facilitate or limit the effective coordination of actors, information, and resources during the response, and (ii) the dynamics that promote or hinder inclusive disaster governance using social domains theory. This article aims to present the main challenges, successful practices, broad trends, and significant opportunities to help responders and humanitarians improve cooperation while assisting and protecting vulnerable populations from compound risks and simultaneous disasters. It also seeks to support researchers and policymakers by offering an expanded framework for assessing and improving the governance of future joint disaster responses in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. Third, the “downward” or decentralization of disaster risk governance arguably enables local communities to formulate realistic and implementable prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery plans. In this complex and changing governance landscape of disaster risk reduction, as the neoliberal state is hollowed out and responsibilities are reoriented upward, outward, and downward, the question arises: “who really governs DRR?”<br><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123964519000044" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780123964519000044</a></li><li id="tree-E3621395530"><strong>E3621395530:</strong> There is confirmed evidence that post-­disaster intervention after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami emerged as a governance network.

Empirical studies on DWM were reviewed to clarify the current understanding of how DWM operation is affected by other nontechnical aspects. This knowledge was then incorporated into the disaster waste governance model, based on the perspectives of network governance theory, to capture the collaborative nature of DWM. The new model assumes that waste governance competency, consisting of actor capacity and network competency, rests at the core, connecting waste management after disasters with solid waste management, preparedness, and mitigation in normal times. A detailed description of this disaster waste governance model is further provided by drawing on examples from recent disasters in Japan and other countries.

In terms of interoperability, blockchain can be adopted as a universal system across organizations—similar to the internet—and allow multiple parties across that system to coordinate resources in an emergency. In a disaster relief scenario, multiple parties are often contributing resources to aid an affected area. If all parties involved in this scenario were to adopt a blockchain-based shared system of record, they could coordinate more efficient disaster responses, ensuring resources were allocated to the areas where they are needed most.

The utilities report that machine learning has provided critical information to help them improve decision making. In another example, a startup has developed a cross-hazard platform using both engineering-based and machine-learning models to provide information to community leaders and emergency managers that enhance both long-term disaster resilience and short-term disaster response. The answer lies in our ability to better forecast, plan for and respond to natural disasters. New technologies that can analyze massive amounts of data are very promising tools that can help community leaders and emergency managers make more informed decisions. These technologies, developed from the field of machine learning, can supplement and enhance existing disaster response programs. They can only process and analyze information that has been input into the computer. For example, if data for an extremely large disaster is not part of the data set, machine-learning technologies likely cannot make accurate predictions for a comparable event in the future. Machine-learning predictions come with uncertainty that can be difficult for decision makers to fully understand.

Of all risk reduction and climate change adaptation measures, early warning and early action stand as one of the best-proven and cost-effective methods to save lives and reduce the economic impact of natural hazards. UNESCO supports countries in establishing, maintaining and improving early warning systems, which are an essential component of disaster risk reduction. Early Warning Systems are "an integrated system of hazard monitoring, forecasting and prediction, disaster risk assessment, communication and preparedness activities systems and processes that enable individuals, communities, governments, businesses, and others to take timely action to reduce disaster risks in advance of hazardous events." It emphasizes the need for a developmental approach rather than crisis management through its international science programme, notably the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Programme, the Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme (IHP) and the Local and Indigenous Knowledge Systems programme (LINKS). These programmes aim to reduce communities’ vulnerability to flooding, droughts, and wildfires by emphasizing the interdependence and need to preserve cultural and biological diversity, as well as the integrated management of water resources. Each year, natural hazards cause significant loss of life and set back the economic and social development of affected countries by years, if not decades.

Extreme events and disasters resulting from climate change or other ecological factors are difficult to predict and manage. Current limitations of state-of-the-art approaches to disaster prediction and management could be addressed by adopting new unorthodox risk assessment and management strategies. In this chapter, we commissioned a survey on emerging wireless communication technologies with potential for enhancing disaster prediction, monitoring, and management systems.

Communities are usually first responders in every disaster and it is intended to actively involve at-risk populations in the identification, analysis, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of disaster risks. While Community Disaster Resilience (CDR) follows a community-systems model, there has been no operational definition of CDR or model demonstration of how best to apply these principles in practice in vulnerable communities. Social vulnerability is defined in terms of the characteristics of a person or group that affect “their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from the impact”. A person’s vulnerability to disaster is influenced by factors like socioeconomic status, age, gender, race and ethnicity, English language proficiency, and medical issues and disability. To be able to assist these vulnerable communities within the community, facilitators must initiate conversation with marginalized communities to understand their needs and in doing so advance community engagement. The CDMC was able to assess and understand disasters based on their knowledge from historical experience and patterns; and were able to navigate Disaster Risk Reduction(DRR) by putting traditional coping mechanisms in place and making sure their entire community, including socially excluded groups such as Dalits, Janajatis, persons with disability, senior citizens, and single women were heard and equipped to deal with impending danger.

Over the last two decades, disasters have claimed nearly 1.23 million lives, impacted livelihoods and cumulated trillions in economic losses, resulting in the destabilization of the socioeconomic fabric of many countries and regions. This poses a challenge to the existing EWSs in terms of detecting these hazards and their impacts. But emerging technologies can play crucial role in strengthening the four pillars of the Early Warnings For All initiatives: disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, dissemination and communication, and preparedness and response. The panelists showcased practical use cases that demonstrate how the different technologies are instrumental in disaster management. Project Sunny Lives, an initiative led by Microsoft in India, employs AI and machine learning to assess vulnerability. Satellite imagery was used to classify seven dwelling types in low-income settlements by employing a U-net-based neural network model. This classification, combined with inundation models, formed a risk assessment system for vulnerable areas.

WMO is seeking to drive digital transformation by exploring the use of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones, Metaverse, Digital Twins, Internet of Things (IoT) and others in the hydrological domain. Over the last two decades, disasters have claimed nearly 1.23 million lives, impacted livelihoods and cumulated trillions in economic losses, resulting in the destabilization of the socioeconomic fabric of many countries and regions. This poses a challenge to the existing EWSs in terms of detecting these hazards and their impacts. But emerging technologies can play crucial role in strengthening the four pillars of the Early Warnings For All initiatives: disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, dissemination and communication, and preparedness and response. The panelists showcased practical use cases that demonstrate how the different technologies are instrumental in disaster management. Project Sunny Lives, an initiative led by Microsoft in India, employs AI and machine learning to assess vulnerability. Satellite imagery was used to classify seven dwelling types in low-income settlements by employing a U-net-based neural network model. This classification, combined with inundation models, formed a risk assessment system for vulnerable areas. The Drought in Numbers report notes that more than half a million lives were lost due to droughts between 1970 and 2019. WMO recognizes that the emergence of frontier technologies could have a transformational impact flood and drought disaster risk management.<br><a href="https://wmo.int/media/magazine-article/harnessing-emerging-technologies-disaster-risk-reduction" target="_blank">https://wmo.int/media/magazine-article/harnessing-emerging-technologies-disaster-risk-reduction</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S3443210316" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S1721668464"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S1721668464</h3><ul><li id="tree-S1721668464"><strong>S1721668464:</strong> The National Response Framework (NRF) provides a structured approach for integrating new technologies into disaster response by organizing federal agencies to manage responses collaboratively.<ul><li id="tree-E2044486269"><strong>E2044486269:</strong> Every level of government — from local to federal — has a role.

In this blog post, we discuss the importance of community engagement in disaster management and how it can save lives and prevent further damage. The Potential for Community Engagement is extremely vast. There isn’t an operational definition of CDR or model demonstration. Communities are usually first responders in every disaster and it is intended to actively involve at-risk populations in the identification, analysis, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of disaster risks. While Community Disaster Resilience (CDR) follows a community-systems model, there has been no operational definition of CDR or model demonstration of how best to apply these principles in practice in vulnerable communities. Social vulnerability is defined in terms of the characteristics of a person or group that affect “their capacity to anticipate, cope with, resist, and recover from the impact”. A person’s vulnerability to disaster is influenced by factors like socioeconomic status, age, gender, race and ethnicity, English language proficiency, and medical issues and disability. To be able to assist these vulnerable communities within the community, facilitators must initiate conversation with marginalized communities to understand their needs and in doing so advance community engagement. The CDMC was able to assess and understand disasters based on their knowledge from historical experience and patterns; and were able to navigate Disaster Risk Reduction(DRR) by putting traditional coping mechanisms in place and making sure their entire community, including socially excluded groups such as Dalits, Janajatis, persons with disability, senior citizens, and single women were heard and equipped to deal with impending danger. Community Engagement in Disaster management lends a huge helping hand to the Government.<br><a href="https://www.sakalrelieffund.com/blog/the-importance-of-community-engagement-in-disaster-management-lessons-from-ngos-in-india/" target="_blank">https://www.sakalrelieffund.com/blog/the-importance-of-community-engagement-in-disaster-management-lessons-from-ngos-in-india/</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S3989099640" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S9264861147"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S9264861147</h3><ul><li id="tree-S9264861147"><strong>S9264861147:</strong> Socio-political dynamics, including social inequality and community involvement, are critical for the effectiveness of disaster sensor networks, as they enhance resilience and response capabilities during disasters.<ul><li id="tree-E4902725574"><strong>E4902725574:</strong> By implementing a situational analysis approach, this study details an exploratory investigation into the socioeconomic and environmental constructs of rural high flood-risk communities to identify capacities that may be enhanced for improved flood risk reduction through participatory early warning system approaches.

As satellite-based systems are less susceptible to ground-based disasters, satellite-based communication channels often remain operational when terrestrial networks are compromised. Satellite communications are also integral to efforts to predict when a natural disaster might strike – especially in disaster-prone areas that experience the worse effects of adverse weather and climate change. Emergency management agencies can use satellite communications to not only detect and monitor any incoming threats, such as hurricanes and tsunamis, but also to deliver public service announcements, safety guidelines and information about evacuation routes and shelter locations to help individuals stay informed and prepared to respond effectively to any given crisis, minimising panic and confusion. Satellite communications not only play a crucial role in facilitating real-time communication and coordination during emergencies but also in assessing the damage and supporting recovery efforts after a disaster. By leveraging satellite technology, responders gain valuable insights into the level of destruction and strategise recovery plans accordingly. Satellite communications play a multifaceted role in disaster management, not only supporting real-time communication and coordination during emergencies but also assisting in the assessment of damage and facilitating the recovery process. By leveraging satellite technology, responders can gather crucial data on structural damage, environmental conditions and project progress.

Disaster governance is an emerging concept in the disaster research literature that is closely related to risk governance and environmental governance. Disaster governance arrangements and challenges are shaped by forces such as globalization, world-system dynamics, social inequality, and sociodemographic trends. Disaster governance arrangements and challenges are shaped by forces such as globalization, world-system dynamics, social inequality, and sociodemographic trends. Governance regimes are polycentric and multiscale, show variation across the hazards cycle, and tend to lack integration and to be formulated in response to particular large-scale disaster events. Disaster governance is nested within and influenced by overarching societal governance systems. Current systems of disaster governance have been shaped by a variety of social, economic, and political forces, including globalization, economic and political dynamics within the world system, and associated sociodemographic trends. As noted earlier, globalization has influenced the forms of governance that have emerged to manage the risks associated with disasters, just as it has influenced governance more generally. The broad goals of the HFA are to (a) ensure that disaster risk reduction is a national and local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation; (b) identify, assess, and monitor disaster risks and enhance early warning; (c) use knowledge and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels; (d) reduce underlying disaster risk factors; and (e) strengthen disaster preparedness at all levels.<br><a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-environ-020911-095618" target="_blank">https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-environ-020911-095618</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S7362134049" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S6518323506"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S6518323506</h3><ul><li id="tree-S6518323506"><strong>S6518323506:</strong> Community engagement is a critical socio-political factor in the implementation of disaster sensor networks, enhancing local involvement and response capabilities during emergencies.<ul><li id="tree-E8726158724"><strong>E8726158724:</strong> Snippet text not found for ID: E8726158724</li><li id="tree-S4411635381"><strong>S4411635381:</strong> Community engagement is vital for enhancing disaster monitoring systems, as it significantly contributes to saving lives and reducing injuries during disasters.<ul><li id="tree-E1345172183"><strong>E1345172183:</strong> Engaging the community in Early Warning Systems (EWSs) plays an essential role in saving lives, reducing injuries, and limiting environmental damage associated with disaster events.

Can a nation prevent a hazard-related disaster by investing in socioeconomic and political policy tools? Drawing on 8 global datasets (1960–2016) and using a fixed effects logit model, we examine the importance of socioeconomic and political factors in changing the likelihood of disasters in 224 countries. We find that socioeconomic factors are of more importance than political factors. Low-income countries are significantly more disaster prone than high-income countries; this effect is stronger and more robust for natural than technological disasters. Higher national population density increases the probability that a hazard turns into a disaster; this effect is much stronger and robust for technological than natural disasters.

WMO is seeking to drive digital transformation by exploring the use of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones, Metaverse, Digital Twins, Internet of Things (IoT) and others in the hydrological domain. Over the last two decades, disasters have claimed nearly 1.23 million lives, impacted livelihoods and cumulated trillions in economic losses, resulting in the destabilization of the socioeconomic fabric of many countries and regions. This poses a challenge to the existing EWSs in terms of detecting these hazards and their impacts. But emerging technologies can play crucial role in strengthening the four pillars of the Early Warnings For All initiatives: disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, dissemination and communication, and preparedness and response. The panelists showcased practical use cases that demonstrate how the different technologies are instrumental in disaster management. Project Sunny Lives, an initiative led by Microsoft in India, employs AI and machine learning to assess vulnerability. Satellite imagery was used to classify seven dwelling types in low-income settlements by employing a U-net-based neural network model. This classification, combined with inundation models, formed a risk assessment system for vulnerable areas. The Drought in Numbers report notes that more than half a million lives were lost due to droughts between 1970 and 2019.

This technology is especially beneficial in regions vulnerable to rapid natural disasters like tsunamis or earthquakes, requiring immediate responses. Respondents can leverage mobile devices to coordinate efforts, monitor resources, and share real-time information, leading to more effective and timely responses during critical situations. However, technology transformed these approaches in the late 20th century, introducing advanced tools and systems that improved disaster response and precision. What began with simple manual methods has today evolved into an advanced high-tech approach. Successful implementation and effectiveness of technology in disaster management and response rely on education. Institutions offering degrees such as bachelor in homeland security and cybersecurity prepare professionals to protect critical disaster response technologies, ensuring they can effectively counter and manage cyber threats. Hence, it is necessary to equip individuals with the knowledge and skills to use the advanced technology. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have revolutionized disaster management by offering advanced tools. Technologies like advanced mesh networks, which do not rely on traditional infrastructure, will maintain communication when conventional systems fail. Virtual reality (VR) offers revolutionary potential for disaster management, especially in training. By creating detailed virtual scenarios, VR will improve scenario planning and real-time crisis management, enabling more effective decision-making and coordination during actual emergencies.<br><a href="https://itsupplychain.com/the-role-of-technology-in-disaster-management-and-response/" target="_blank">https://itsupplychain.com/the-role-of-technology-in-disaster-management-and-response/</a></li><li id="tree-E6408070972"><strong>E6408070972:</strong> Institutions offering degrees such as bachelor in homeland security and cybersecurity prepare professionals to protect critical disaster response technologies, ensuring they can effectively counter and manage cyber threats.

It is highly essential to improve their capacities to equip them to be able to respond efficiently to disasters. The involvement of communities leads to the understanding of disasters and traditional coping mechanisms, which proves to be very effective in an emergency. Despite its significance, trust in many of the institutions necessary for effective preparedness has been declining recently. The legitimacy and significance of anticipated dangers are questioned as a result of a lack of trust in institutions and organizations, which negatively affects planning and adherence to advised activities. Limited Resources Or Capacity To Participate In Disaster Planning And Response Given that disasters are unexpected, local resources are often overwhelmed, and response is facilitated by first responders which are usually communities. Most of them are very successful during the project period but gradually diminish as the years pass. The lack of effective participation and capacity building of the local communities remains a major factor in the lack of sustainability.

The paper examines the relationship between community participation and disaster mitigation measures using a case study of disaster mitigation response during the Kochi flood of 2018 and 2019 in Kerala, India. We investigate five disaster mitigation behaviours: disaster event planning, experience from previous similar events, following disaster-related updates closely, neighbourhood relationships, and community participation. The study analysed socio-economic significance, modelled the probability of engaging in community events, and quantified the relationship between community participation and disaster mitigation behaviours by estimating conditional probabilities. Taking ideas from such measures could improve community participation leading to increased disaster preparedness by disaster mitigation professionals. Even though numerous studies highlight the relevance of community participation in disaster mitigation (Ada and Bolat 2010; Aldrich 2011a, 2012; Koh and Cadigan 2008; Mathbor 2007), post-disaster aid primarily focuses on physical restoration from the effects of the disaster.

WMO is seeking to drive digital transformation by exploring the use of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), drones, Metaverse, Digital Twins, Internet of Things (IoT) and others in the hydrological domain. Over the last two decades, disasters have claimed nearly 1.23 million lives, impacted livelihoods and cumulated trillions in economic losses, resulting in the destabilization of the socioeconomic fabric of many countries and regions. This poses a challenge to the existing EWSs in terms of detecting these hazards and their impacts. But emerging technologies can play crucial role in strengthening the four pillars of the Early Warnings For All initiatives: disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, dissemination and communication, and preparedness and response. The panelists showcased practical use cases that demonstrate how the different technologies are instrumental in disaster management. Project Sunny Lives, an initiative led by Microsoft in India, employs AI and machine learning to assess vulnerability. Satellite imagery was used to classify seven dwelling types in low-income settlements by employing a U-net-based neural network model. This classification, combined with inundation models, formed a risk assessment system for vulnerable areas. The Drought in Numbers report notes that more than half a million lives were lost due to droughts between 1970 and 2019.

One paradigm that has emerged in response is community resilience (CR).9,10 Based on a community-systems model,11,12 CR refers to community capabilities that buffer it from or support effective responses to disasters.13,14 Such capabilities include effective risk communications, organizational partnerships and networks, and community engagement to improve, prepare for, and respond to disasters. We found that CPPR was well-suited to bringing community engagement principles into disaster planning, given that all tasks were completed in 18 months with extensive stakeholder input. We found that concrete strategies such as pairing community and academic cochairs, reflection sheets to ensure community input and responsiveness, and use of community engagement exercises helped achieve support for collaboratively developed action plans while building relationships that will improve implementation. This article focuses on how the Council then used community engagement principles and the CPPR model to develop the project’s CR intervention framework, propose and develop a toolkit containing training and other resources to improve CR, and design a demonstration to compare the effectiveness of implementing the CR toolkit with the enhanced standard approach that emphasizes individual or family preparedness.15,36 · The Council convened a Community Kick-Off Conference in March 2011, attended by more than 50 representatives of LACDPH; the Emergency Network of Los Angeles (ENLA), which is the What components of the toolkit are most feasible and effective?
