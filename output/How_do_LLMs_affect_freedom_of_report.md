This report documents Russian authorities\u2019 stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews, and shut down or blocked access to hundreds of websites and web pages. While new restrictions on freedom of expression appear to target political opposition or civic groups, they affect all Russians. Curbing free speech denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or even mildly critical of Russia\u2019s foreign policy. The Russian government\u2019s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information. Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online. Authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens on criminal charges for social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews. Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term.",

As of 2023, Russia ranked 164 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Despite the constitution's provision of freedom of speech, the authorities possess significant discretion to suppress any speech, organization, or activity lacking official support due to ambiguous extremism laws. The Russian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; however, government application of law, bureaucratic regulation, and politically motivated criminal investigations have forced the press to exercise self-censorship constraining its coverage of certain controversial issues, resulting in infringements of these rights. Russian Ombudsman Vladimir Lukin reported in 2006 that claims declaring that freedom of speech is non-existent in Russia would be an exaggeration, the constitutional right for speech freedom is basically observed, and there is no institutionalized censorship. Russian head of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs Konstantin Kosachev said in a 2005 interview that there were no differences between freedom of speech in Russia and Western countries in regards to the printed media: \"there is an enormous amount of newspapers which write any sort of stuff.\" While there are provisions in the Russian Constitution that guarantee freedom of speech and specifically forbid censorship, the practical execution of numerous legal acts and dependence of courts results in practically unlimited control of the government over what is published and where.",

For years Kremlin critics have faced a host of laws which could be used against them, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that toolbox of measures has swelled in size. The laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia's constitution. In April 2023, prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail on charges of treason and spreading \"false information\" about the Russian army. His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools. Among Russia's \"foreign agents\" are election monitor Golos, prominent pollster Levada Centre, rights group OVD-Info, a movement of wives of mobilised soldiers called The Way Home and numerous independent news websites and journalists including Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov. According to prominent Russian human rights group OVD-Info, more than 300 people have since been charged or convicted under it.",

For example, in October, prisoner of conscience and former opposition municipal councillor Aleksei Gorinov, who had been sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment in 2022 for an anti-war speech at a council meeting, was charged with \u201cjustification of terrorism\u201d. In November, another prisoner of conscience, journalist Maria Ponomarenko, who had been sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment for sharing a video about Russia\u2019s bombing of the drama theatre in Mariupol, Ukraine, faced new dubious charges for \u201ccausing bodily harm\u201d to penal colony personnel. Freedom of assembly remained suppressed. Russia continued its war of aggression against Ukraine and allowed its forces to commit war crimes with impunity. Meanwhile, the human rights situation at home continued to deteriorate. Freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association were further severely restricted. New transphobic legislation was adopted, and the so-called \u201cLGBT movement\u201d was designated as \u201cextremist\u201d. Russia refused to cooperate with international human rights institutions and, after the ICC issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin, criminalized assistance to it. Russia committed numerous violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine (see Ukraine entry), while its invasion largely stalled. Ukrainian military attacks reached deeper inside Russian territory, and Russian authorities reported dozens of civilian casualties.",

And, unlike the ideal tyranny, it kills and sues not most of the local opposition, but several people here and there. Terror is not omnipresent. Even in Belarus it's not. We have no freedom of speech.",

(Moscow) \u2013 Russia has introduced significant restrictions to online speech and invasive surveillance of online activity and prosecutes critics under the guise of fighting extremism, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 83-page report, \u201cOnline and On All Fronts: Russia\u2019s Assault on Freedom of Expression,\u201d documents Russian authorities\u2019 stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Curbing free speech serves to shut down public debate and denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or simply critical of Russia\u2019s foreign policy, Human Rights Watch said. \u201cWe have dozens of cases where people were literally sent to jail,\u201d Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist and expert on internet freedom in Russia, told Human Rights Watch. Based on the data provided by the SOVA Center, a prominent Russian think tank, the number of social media users convicted of extremism offenses in 2015 was 216, in comparison with 30 in 2010. Between 2014 and 2016, approximately 85 percent of convictions for \u201cextremist expression\u201d dealt with online expression, with punishments ranging from fines or community service to prison time. In the period between September 2015 and February 2017, the number of people who went to jail for extremist speech spiked from 54 to 94. They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. \u201cThe Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,\u201d Gorbunova said. \u201cToday people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.\u201d",

  "reflection": "The current question, \"How do LLMs affect freedom of speech in Russia,\" directly relates to the main research question by focusing on the implications of large language models (LLMs) on the already restricted landscape of free speech in Russia. The search results reveal a significant crackdown on freedom of expression in Russia, particularly through legal measures that target online speech and dissent. Key pieces of information include the introduction of laws that criminalize criticism of the government, the prosecution of individuals for social media posts, and the pervasive atmosphere of self-censorship among the populace. There are gaps in understanding how LLMs specifically interact with these existing restrictions; however, the evidence suggests that any technology, including LLMs, would operate within a framework of stringent controls. The context indicates that the Russian government employs vague laws to suppress dissent, which could extend to the use of LLMs if they are perceived as a threat to state narratives. Overall, the evidence highlights a deteriorating environment for free speech, which is crucial for understanding the potential impact of LLMs in this context.",

The report states, \"Russian authorities have punished a wide range of speech and actions criticizing Russia's war against Ukraine with criminal or administrative charges,\" indicating a broader trend of repression that could encompass the use of LLMs."
