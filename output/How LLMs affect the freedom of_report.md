How LLMs affect the freedom of speech in Russia?

### Generated Statements

#### Statement 1 (ID: S9461963264)

**Statement:** The Russian government has intensified its control over online speech, leading to a significant chilling effect on freedom of expression among its citizens.

**Evidence:**
- E3822760859: This report documents Russian authorities’ stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, ...
- E4469920138: While new restrictions on freedom of expression appear to target political opposition or civic groups, they affect all Russians. Curbing free speech denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or even mildly critical of Russia’s foreign policy.
- E4814339230: The Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information.
- E9960261900: Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online. Authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens on criminal charges for social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews. Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term.

**Support Score:** 0.95

**Explanation:** The evidence indicates that Russian authorities have intensified measures to control the internet and restrict freedom of expression, with unjust prosecutions for online content and a general atmosphere of fear regarding acceptable speech. This is supported by the statement that 'the Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society.'

#### Statement 2 (ID: S5569890602)

**Statement:** Legal restrictions on free speech in Russia have been increasingly justified by the government as necessary for national security, contributing to a hostile environment for dissent.

**Evidence:**
- E4602250354: Dmitry Dubrovskiy, Executive Director, Ethnic Studies Program, European University; Chair, Department of Modern Ethnography, Russian Museum of Ethnography, St. Petersburg; and Galina Starovoitova Fellow on Human Rights and Conflict Resolution, Kennan Institute
- E6777023492: Russia has a long tradition of official censorship, Dubrovskiy observed. In the tsarist era, censorship was employed by the state to defend state security in the "public interest." Restriction on free expression continued and expanded during the Soviet era. It was only in the 1980s during perestroika that restrictions on free speech began to be eased. As the country transitioned into the 1990s, freedom of speech was greater than ever before.
- E4989867344: The Russian government has the power to make such determinations, he observed, and is using that power to define speech that it does not like as "extremist." He noted that the government is successfully finding experts willing to testify in support of their claims, thereby providing a basis for these cases and in effect helping the government to restrict the freedom of speech and academic inquiry.

**Support Score:** 0.92

**Explanation:** Dmitry Dubrovskiy notes that legal restrictions on free speech in Russia have been enacted under the pretext of national security and combating extremism, which has historically been used to justify censorship. This aligns with the current environment where the government defines dissenting speech as extremist.

#### Statement 3 (ID: S2845484206)

**Statement:** In practice, freedom of speech in Russia is severely limited by government discretion and the application of vague laws, resulting in widespread self-censorship.

**Evidence:**
- E2898728916: As of 2023, Russia ranked 164 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Despite the constitution&#x27;s provision of freedom of speech, the authorities possess significant discretion to suppress any speech, organization, or activity lacking official support ...
- E8335605178: The Russian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; however, government application of law, bureaucratic regulation, and politically motivated criminal investigations have forced the press to exercise self-censorship constraining its coverage of certain controversial issues, resulting in infringements of these rights.
- E7360330820: While there are provisions in the Russian Constitution that guarantee freedom of speech and specifically forbid censorship, the practical execution of numerous legal acts and dependence of courts results in practically unlimited control of the government over what is published and where.

**Support Score:** 0.93

**Explanation:** Despite constitutional guarantees for freedom of speech, the practical application of laws in Russia allows for significant government control over media and expression, leading to self-censorship among journalists and the public. This is evidenced by the statement that 'the authorities possess significant discretion to suppress any speech, organization, or activity lacking official support.'

#### Statement 4 (ID: S1274676004)

**Statement:** The introduction of invasive surveillance and restrictions on online speech by the Russian government has led to increased self-censorship among citizens.

**Evidence:**
- E9803982710: Russia has introduced significant restrictions to online speech and invasive surveillance of online activity and prosecutes critics under the guise of fighting extremism, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.
- E2978855215: (Moscow) – Russia has introduced significant restrictions to online speech and invasive surveillance of online activity and prosecutes critics under the guise of fighting extremism, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 83-page report, “Online and On All Fronts: Russia’s Assault on Freedom of Expression,” documents Russian authorities’ stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control.
- E5858616059: They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. “The Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,” Gorbunova said. “Today people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.”

**Support Score:** 0.94

**Explanation:** Human Rights Watch reports that the Russian government has introduced significant restrictions on online speech and invasive surveillance, which has led to increased prosecutions for online expression. This creates an environment where citizens are unsure about acceptable speech, fostering self-censorship.

**Over-explored Areas:**
- The impact of government control on online speech
- Self-censorship among citizens due to legal restrictions

**Under-explored Areas:**
- The specific role of LLMs in shaping public discourse
