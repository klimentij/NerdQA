Wearing Masks: In situations where avoiding crowds is not possible, wearing masks can provide a barrier against respiratory droplets that may contain infectious agents, including those that cause pneumonia. Minimizing Visitor Contact: For individuals at high risk of bacterial pneumonia, limiting the number of visitors and ensuring that any essential visitors wear masks can further reduce the risk of exposure to infectious agents. Pneumonia is a respiratory condition characterized by inflammation of the lungs, primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. While it can be caused by various agents, including viruses, fungi, and bacteria, bacterial pneumonia is particularly significant due to its impact on public health.

THE FACTS: There’s no evidence that normal use of face masks can cause fungal or bacterial infections. On June 19, a Florida congressional candidate posted a tweet claiming that wearing face masks could lead to pneumonia. “Excessive use of face masks causes fungal and bacterial pneumonia,” wrote Jessi Melton, a conservative business owner who is running to represent Florida’s 22nd Congressional District. Davidson Hamer, an infectious disease specialist at Boston University, said he was unaware of any harm that comes from wearing masks besides discomfort. “There’s no evidence of masks leading to fungal or bacterial infections of the upper airway or the lower airway as in pneumonia,” said Hamer, who is also a professor of global health and medicine at the university. Digging into it a little bit more, in terms of mask use, it is important to follow general sanitation guidelines.” She said it’s important that disposable masks be discarded and cloth masks be washed. “The idea that contamination could cause fungal pneumonia is not a valid conclusion,” she said. Monroe agreed with Hamer that it’s “potentially theoretical,” but that it has not been documented.
