This report documents Russian authorities\u2019 stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews, and shut down or blocked access to hundreds of websites and web pages. While new restrictions on freedom of expression appear to target political opposition or civic groups, they affect all Russians. Curbing free speech denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or even mildly critical of Russia\u2019s foreign policy. The Russian government\u2019s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information. Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online. Authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens on criminal charges for social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews. Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term.",

As of 2023, Russia ranked 164 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Despite the constitution's provision of freedom of speech, the authorities possess significant discretion to suppress any speech, organization, or activity lacking official support due to ambiguous extremism laws. The Russian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; however, government application of law, bureaucratic regulation, and politically motivated criminal investigations have forced the press to exercise self-censorship constraining its coverage of certain controversial issues, resulting in infringements of these rights. Russian Ombudsman Vladimir Lukin reported in 2006 that claims declaring that freedom of speech is non-existent in Russia would be an exaggeration, the constitutional right for speech freedom is basically observed, and there is no institutionalized censorship. Russian head of the Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs Konstantin Kosachev said in a 2005 interview that there were no differences between freedom of speech in Russia and Western countries in regards to the printed media: \"there is an enormous amount of newspapers which write any sort of stuff.\" While there are provisions in the Russian Constitution that guarantee freedom of speech and specifically forbid censorship, the practical execution of numerous legal acts and dependence of courts results in practically unlimited control of the government over what is published and where.",

For years Kremlin critics have faced a host of laws which could be used against them, and since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that toolbox of measures has swelled in size. The laws target basic rights such as freedom of speech and freedom of assembly - even though they are enshrined in Russia's constitution. In April 2023, prominent opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was sentenced to 25 years in jail on charges of treason and spreading \"false information\" about the Russian army. His case was partly based on a speech in which he accused Russian troops in Ukraine of committing war crimes by using cluster bombs in residential areas and bombing maternity hospitals and schools. Among Russia's \"foreign agents\" are election monitor Golos, prominent pollster Levada Centre, rights group OVD-Info, a movement of wives of mobilised soldiers called The Way Home and numerous independent news websites and journalists including Nobel Peace Prize winner Dmitry Muratov. According to prominent Russian human rights group OVD-Info, more than 300 people have since been charged or convicted under it.",

For example, in October, prisoner of conscience and former opposition municipal councillor Aleksei Gorinov, who had been sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment in 2022 for an anti-war speech at a council meeting, was charged with \u201cjustification of terrorism\u201d. In November, another prisoner of conscience, journalist Maria Ponomarenko, who had been sentenced to six years\u2019 imprisonment for sharing a video about Russia\u2019s bombing of the drama theatre in Mariupol, Ukraine, faced new dubious charges for \u201ccausing bodily harm\u201d to penal colony personnel. Freedom of assembly remained suppressed. Russia continued its war of aggression against Ukraine and allowed its forces to commit war crimes with impunity. Meanwhile, the human rights situation at home continued to deteriorate. Freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association were further severely restricted. New transphobic legislation was adopted, and the so-called \u201cLGBT movement\u201d was designated as \u201cextremist\u201d. Russia refused to cooperate with international human rights institutions and, after the ICC issued an arrest warrant for President Vladimir Putin, criminalized assistance to it. Russia committed numerous violations of international humanitarian law in Ukraine (see Ukraine entry), while its invasion largely stalled. Ukrainian military attacks reached deeper inside Russian territory, and Russian authorities reported dozens of civilian casualties.",

(Moscow) \u2013 Russia has introduced significant restrictions to online speech and invasive surveillance of online activity and prosecutes critics under the guise of fighting extremism, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 83-page report, \u201cOnline and On All Fronts: Russia\u2019s Assault on Freedom of Expression,\u201d documents Russian authorities\u2019 stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Curbing free speech serves to shut down public debate and denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or simply critical of Russia\u2019s foreign policy, Human Rights Watch said. \u201cWe have dozens of cases where people were literally sent to jail,\u201d Andrei Soldatov, an investigative journalist and expert on internet freedom in Russia, told Human Rights Watch. Based on the data provided by the SOVA Center, a prominent Russian think tank, the number of social media users convicted of extremism offenses in 2015 was 216, in comparison with 30 in 2010. Between 2014 and 2016, approximately 85 percent of convictions for \u201cextremist expression\u201d dealt with online expression, with punishments ranging from fines or community service to prison time. In the period between September 2015 and February 2017, the number of people who went to jail for extremist speech spiked from 54 to 94. They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. \u201cThe Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,\u201d Gorbunova said. \u201cToday people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.\u201d",

  "reflection": "The current question, \"How do LLMs affect freedom of speech in Russia,\" is closely related to the main research question, as both seek to understand the implications of language models on the expression of ideas and opinions in a repressive environment. The search results reveal a significant crackdown on freedom of speech in Russia, particularly in the context of online expression, where authorities have implemented strict regulations and surveillance measures. Key pieces of information indicate that since 2012, the Russian government has intensified its control over the internet, prosecuting individuals for their online expressions and limiting access to information. This context highlights the broader implications of LLMs, as they could either be tools for enhancing free speech or instruments for further repression, depending on how they are utilized and regulated. There are gaps in understanding how LLMs specifically interact with these existing restrictions, as the current evidence does not directly address their role. However, the evidence does illustrate a climate of fear and self-censorship among the populace, which could be exacerbated or mitigated by the deployment of LLMs. Overall, the context is relevant as it outlines the existing landscape of freedom of speech in Russia, which is crucial for assessing the potential impact of LLMs.",

This report documents Russian authorities\u2019 stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews, and shut down or blocked access to hundreds of websites and web pages. The Russian government\u2019s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information. The numbers of criminal extremism cases have risen dramatically, sending a powerful warning about the limits of free speech on certain topics, such as Russia\u2019s role in Ukraine and the promotion of traditional values. Pavel Chikov, a human rights lawyer, said: Internet users may not be afraid of being blocked but everyone fears jail time.[202] Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term. State intrusion in media affairs has reached a level not seen in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The laws passed since 2012 have dramatically increased the state\u2019s control over the media landscape. With few exceptions, mainstream media outlets have become the voice of the state and use elaborate propaganda tools to mobilize patriotic support for the government.",

MOSCOW \u2014 Russia is in the midst of the largest crackdown on the free press and political dissent since the Soviet era. The trends driving it are numerous, and they have been in place for years. But in the last 18 months, the state has increased its pressure on journalism extraordinarily. Instead of overt brutality, the campaign is being waged quietly with a vague legal tool: a law regulating the activities of so-called foreign agents. It was first used against a media outlet in 2017, when several U.S.-government funded outlets, such as the Voice of America, were declared foreign agents. The Kremlin's moves against domestic dissent have sparked fears of a return to the communist era's approach to free speech.Spencer Platt / Getty Images \u00b7 The foreign agent law was signed in 2012. Before its first use against the media in 2017, it was used against nongovernmental organizations and civil society groups \u2014 often those that focus on human rights \u2014 that had received foreign grant money. \u201cI don\u2019t think there has ever been a worse time for Russian civic society and media in general,\u201d said Alexey Kovalev, an editor at the independent news site Meduza. President Vladimir Putin addressed the law at a forum in Moscow on Wednesday, defending the foreign agent list as a routine act of bureaucracy, akin to the Foreign Agent Registration Act in the U.S. The U.S. law requires think tanks, lobbyists and foreign state-funded media outlets to report financial ties to foreign governments, but it is less aggressive than the Russian law. \u201cThis law was adopted in the United States in the 1930s, and it is still in use today, applied to Russian media outlets, among other things,\u201d Putin said. The Committee to Protect Journalists also warned that Russia would take it one step further and use its version of the registration act against independent media outlets.",

(Moscow) \u2013 Russia has introduced significant restrictions to online speech and invasive surveillance of online activity and prosecutes critics under the guise of fighting extremism, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 83-page report, \u201cOnline and On All Fronts: Russia\u2019s Assault on Freedom of Expression,\u201d documents Russian authorities\u2019 stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Based on the data provided by the SOVA Center, a prominent Russian think tank, the number of social media users convicted of extremism offenses in 2015 was 216, in comparison with 30 in 2010. Between 2014 and 2016, approximately 85 percent of convictions for \u201cextremist expression\u201d dealt with online expression, with punishments ranging from fines or community service to prison time. In the period between September 2015 and February 2017, the number of people who went to jail for extremist speech spiked from 54 to 94. Major internet companies operating in Russia, such as Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and VK should carefully assess Russia\u2019s government demands to censor content or share user data and refrain from complying where the underlying law or specific request are inconsistent with international human rights standards. They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. \u201cThe Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,\u201d Gorbunova said. \u201cToday people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.\u201d Some of the restrictive laws appear designed to shrink the space, including online, for public debate, especially on issues the authorities view as divisive or sensitive, such as the armed conflict in Ukraine, Russia\u2019s role in the war in Syria, the rights of LGBT people, and public protests or other political and civic activism. Curbing free speech serves to shut down public debate and denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or simply critical of Russia\u2019s foreign policy, Human Rights Watch said.",

This is the question facing liberal democracies across the world as Russia and others exploit free speech and its institutions \u2013 especially traditional and social media \u2013 through misinformation and electoral interference. Like a virus that turns its host\u2019s immune system against itself, Russia\u2019s information strategy works by turning free media and free speech against its own society. It uses a mix of Russian-owned media outlets, most notably RT (formerly Russia Today) and Sputnik, sympathetic talking heads, social media \u201cbot\u201d accounts and state-sponsored hackers to influence western politics and media coverage. The aim is rarely to push out one single message, but rather to diminish trust in western institutions, destabilise countries or counter narratives that would be unhelpful to Russia. When the Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent in Salisbury, Russian-backed outlets and supporters threw question after question to cast doubt on the official narrative and muddy it up.",

  "reflection": "The current question, which seeks examples of LLMs used for free speech in Russia, is closely related to the main research question regarding how LLMs affect freedom of speech in the country. However, the search results primarily focus on the restrictions imposed by the Russian government on free speech, particularly in the context of dissent against the war in Ukraine and the broader crackdown on civil society. Key pieces of information highlight the severe legal repercussions for individuals expressing dissenting opinions, the rise of self-censorship, and the government's use of vague laws to suppress free speech. Previous statements indicate that the environment of fear and self-censorship may hinder the effectiveness of LLMs in promoting free speech. There is a notable gap in the evidence regarding specific examples of LLMs being utilized to enhance free speech in Russia, as the context predominantly discusses the limitations and challenges faced by individuals and media outlets. The information retrieved does not provide direct examples of LLM applications in this context, suggesting that the current question may not be adequately addressed by the available evidence.

Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, ... This report documents Russian authorities\u2019 stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews, and shut down or blocked access to hundreds of websites and web pages. The Russian government\u2019s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin\u2019s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information. The numbers of criminal extremism cases have risen dramatically, sending a powerful warning about the limits of free speech on certain topics, such as Russia\u2019s role in Ukraine and the promotion of traditional values. Pavel Chikov, a human rights lawyer, said: Internet users may not be afraid of being blocked but everyone fears jail time.[202] Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term. State intrusion in media affairs has reached a level not seen in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The laws passed since 2012 have dramatically increased the state\u2019s control over the media landscape. With few exceptions, mainstream media outlets have become the voice of the state and use elaborate propaganda tools to mobilize patriotic support for the government.",

State intrusion in media affairs has reached a level not seen in Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union. The laws passed since 2012 have dramatically increased the state\u2019s control over the media landscape. With few exceptions, mainstream media outlets have become the voice of the state and use elaborate propaganda tools to mobilize patriotic support for the government.",

Jan. 22, 2008 ... A number of legal restrictions on free speech have been enacted into law in Russia in recent years on the pretext of national security and combating extremism, reported Dmitry Dubrovskiy, executive director, Ethnic Studies Program, European University; chair, Department of Modern Ethnography, Russian Museum of Ethnography, St. Speaking at a Kennan Institute lecture, he asserted that these new laws are being used to stifle political opposition and to censor mass media. Russia has a long tradition of official censorship, Dubrovskiy observed. In the tsarist era, censorship was employed by the state to defend state security in the \"public interest.\" Restriction on free expression continued and expanded during the Soviet era. It was only in the 1980s during perestroika that restrictions on free speech began to be eased. While the Russian constitution provides for the freedom of speech of Russian citizens, it does not guarantee it as strongly as the first amendment to the U.S. constitution. The Russian constitution prohibits \"propaganda or campaigning\" intended \"to incite social, racial, national, or religious hatred and strife.\" Dubrovskiy explained how these prohibitions have been codified in the Russian criminal code, citing legislation purportedly intended to combat extremism, but which is used in practice to prosecute political opponents or undesirable speech: \u2022 Article 282 prohibits the incitement of hatred or enmity \"if these acts have been committed in public or with the use of mass media.\" The Russian government has the power to make such determinations, he observed, and is using that power to define speech that it does not like as \"extremist.\" He noted that the government is successfully finding experts willing to testify in support of their claims, thereby providing a basis for these cases and in effect helping the government to restrict the freedom of speech and academic inquiry.",

(Moscow) \u2013 Russia has introduced significant restrictions to online speech and invasive surveillance of online activity and prosecutes critics under the guise of fighting extremism, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 83-page report, \u201cOnline and On All Fronts: Russia\u2019s Assault on Freedom of Expression,\u201d documents Russian authorities\u2019 stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Based on the data provided by the SOVA Center, a prominent Russian think tank, the number of social media users convicted of extremism offenses in 2015 was 216, in comparison with 30 in 2010. Between 2014 and 2016, approximately 85 percent of convictions for \u201cextremist expression\u201d dealt with online expression, with punishments ranging from fines or community service to prison time. In the period between September 2015 and February 2017, the number of people who went to jail for extremist speech spiked from 54 to 94. Major internet companies operating in Russia, such as Twitter, Facebook, Microsoft, Google, and VK should carefully assess Russia\u2019s government demands to censor content or share user data and refrain from complying where the underlying law or specific request are inconsistent with international human rights standards. They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. \u201cThe Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,\u201d Gorbunova said. \u201cToday people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.\u201d Some of the restrictive laws appear designed to shrink the space, including online, for public debate, especially on issues the authorities view as divisive or sensitive, such as the armed conflict in Ukraine, Russia\u2019s role in the war in Syria, the rights of LGBT people, and public protests or other political and civic activism. Curbing free speech serves to shut down public debate and denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or simply critical of Russia\u2019s foreign policy, Human Rights Watch said.",

On the eve of the opening of the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, more than 200 authors from 30 countries have published an open letter criticizing recent Russian laws that \u201cstrangle free speech,\u201d joining a wave of protestors denouncing rights abuses in Russia. We therefore urge the Russian authorities to repeal these laws that strangle free speech, to recognise Russia's obligations under the international covenant on civil and political rights to respect freedom of opinion, expression and belief \u2013 including the right not to believe \u2013 and to commit itself to creating an environment in which all citizens can experience the benefit of the free exchange of opinion.\u201d President Vladmir Putin has said it is aimed at protecting Russian children from propaganda about homosexuality and pedophilia, the Guardian reports. He has claimed the law is not discriminatory and that gay people were welcome to attend the Sochi Olympics as long as they \u201cleave children alone.\u201d \u00b7 That comment, as well as the other blasphemy and defamation laws, spurred authors, including Neil Gaiman, to speak out. \"I believe that free expression \u2013 freedom of speech, freedom to write, to argue, to disagree \u2013 is the most important freedom we have as human beings.",

  "reflection": "The current question, which seeks examples of LLMs used for free speech in Russia, is closely related to the main research question regarding how LLMs affect freedom of speech in the country. However, the search results primarily focus on the restrictions imposed by the Russian government on free speech, particularly in the context of the war in Ukraine and the broader crackdown on dissent. Key pieces of information highlight the severe limitations on free expression, including the prosecution of individuals for dissenting opinions and the use of vague laws to suppress criticism. Previous statements indicate that the environment of fear and self-censorship may hinder the effectiveness of LLMs in promoting free speech. There is a notable gap in the evidence regarding specific examples of LLMs being utilized to enhance free speech in Russia, as the context predominantly discusses the oppressive measures against it. The information retrieved does not provide direct examples of LLMs being employed for free speech, which is a critical aspect of the current question. Therefore, while the context is relevant in illustrating the challenges faced by free speech in Russia, it does not directly answer the current question about LLMs. Overall, the evidence underscores a significant contradiction between the potential of LLMs to promote free speech and the reality of their restricted use in an oppressive environment.",
