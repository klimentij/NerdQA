PubMed is a free search engine that provides references and abstracts for medical, life sciences, and biomedical topics. This is one of the free search engines that feels like Yahoo with a massive directory. It could be good when you are just looking for research ideas from unexpected angles. It could lead you to some other database that you might not know such as the CIA The World Factbook, which is a great reference tool. ... Searches more than five billion documents. The Documents tab is very focused on research papers and easy to use. It requires more than 3 clicks to dig up interesting references (which is how it could lead to you something beyond the 1st page of Google) The top part of the results are ALL ads (well… it’s free to use) ...

The present study opens the avenues for comparing the discipline wise knowledge of these GPT based software using a broader set of keywords.

Nelson · Conventional wisdom holds that search engines "prefer" sites that are wide rather than deep, and that having a site index will result in more thorough crawling by the Big Three crawlers - Google, Yahoo, and MSN. Two pieces of information which permit accurate search engine selection are the number of documents indexed by the search engine and the maximum weight of each term. In this paper, we present techniques for the estimation of these two pieces of information. ... The Internet enables collaboration and information sharing on an unprecedented scale. It has become a prime medium for research and extension communication.</td>

The search engines selected for comparison in this study were Yahoo, Google, Gigablast, AlltheWeb, Zworks, AltaVista and Bing/MSN. Results from the repeated exercise are not presented because they were comparable and do not alter the outcomes of the study. Ideally, each query should be executed on all search engines at the same time, so that if a relevant page is added, none should have an advantage of being able to index the new page over the other.
