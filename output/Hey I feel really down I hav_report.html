To take a temperature, you can choose from several types of thermometers, including oral, rectal, ear (tympanic) and forehead (temporal artery) thermometers. When your immune system responds to disease, the hypothalamus can set your body temperature higher. This prompts complex processes that produce more heat and restrict heat loss. The shivering you might experience is one way the body produces heat. When you wrap up in a blanket because you feel chilled, you are helping your body retain heat.

Written by a GP. Localised pain is the primary symptom but weakness also results. Some medicines can cause muscle weakness and muscle damage as a side-effect or as part of an allergic reaction. Usually this begins as tiredness or fatigue. It can progress to permanent changes if the medicines are not stopped. Commonly used medicines which can occasionally do this include statins (used to lower cholesterol levels), some antibiotics (including ciprofloxacin and penicillin) and anti-inflammatory painkillers (such as naproxen and diclofenac). Like anxiety, it stimulates the production of chemical substances (hormones) in the body which respond to pain and injury. These chemicals lead to feelings of tiredness or fatigue. In chronic pain, true weakness can result as muscles may not be used due to pain and discomfort. People with fibromyalgia tend to complain more of the pain than the tiredness or weakness. In this condition, a shortage of thyroid hormone leads to generalised tiredness. In untreated hypothyroidism, muscle degeneration and wasting can develop. This can be severe and difficult to reverse. Hypothyroidism is a common condition but it is usually picked up early and treated before long-lasting muscle problems can result. These range from common to rare, serious to minor, temporary to permanent. Fortunately, most cases of muscle weakness which lack obvious cause are reversible. It is very rare for muscle weakness to be the only sign of serious underlying disease. A medical opinion should be sought for muscle weakness which has persisted for more than a few weeks, particularly if it is severe, localised, painful or has no obvious cause.<br><a href="https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue/muscle-weakness" target="_blank">https://patient.info/signs-symptoms/tiredness-fatigue/muscle-weakness</a></li><li id="tree-E3997303571"><strong>E3997303571:</strong> Muscle weakness can be caused by exercise or getting older, but it can sometimes be a sign of an underlying condition. Learn more about the causes, diagnosis, and treatment. Influenza: The flu virus, or influenza, can cause myositis, or inflammation of muscles, causing muscle weakness, pain, and difficulty walking. Myositis most commonly occurs from an infection like the flu virus. Lyme disease: Lyme disease is an infection transmitted by tick bites. It can cause a variety of systemic symptoms like fever, fatigue, pain, vision changes, memory problems, and generalized muscle weakness. Chronic fatigue syndrome: Chronic fatigue syndrome is a disorder of unknown cause, but may be triggered by an infection, immune system change, or stress, resulting in extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, and muscle and joint pain. Diabetes: People with diabetes can develop complications like diabetic amyotrophy, leading to muscle wasting and weakness, along with extreme pain in the thighs, hips, and buttocks. Fibromyalgia: Fibromyalgia causes widespread pain throughout the body. Common symptoms include pain, fatigue, and tingling and weakness in the arms and legs. Herniated disc: Nerve compression from a herniated disc can prevent the signaling from the nerves to the muscles from being delivered properly, resulting in muscle weakness, numbness, tingling, and pain. Hypotonia: Hypotonia, or a lack of muscle tone, which is the amount of resting tension in a muscle, causes muscles to become flaccid and weak.  · Insomnia: Insomnia is a common sleeping disorder that makes it very difficult to fall asleep at night. Lack of restful sleep interferes with the body’s ability to remove toxins from the body and reduce inflammation, which can result in chronic fatigue and muscle weakness. Lack of restful sleep can cause generalized fatigue and muscle weakness, and narcolepsy can also cause brief periods of exaggerated muscle weakness, called cataplexy. Neuralgia: Nerve pain, or neuralgia, results from damaged or irritated nerves. While neuralgia can occur anywhere in the body, it is common in the face—this type is called trigeminal neuralgia.<br><a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/muscle-weakness-5199929" target="_blank">https://www.verywellhealth.com/muscle-weakness-5199929</a></li><li id="tree-E6706678647"><strong>E6706678647:</strong> Muscle weakness occurs when your full effort doesn’t produce a normal contraction.
