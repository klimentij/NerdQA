Viral and bacterial pneumonia are contagious, while others are not. Here’s how to avoid catching or spreading pneumonia. Certain bacterial strains, however—such as the bacteria that also causes tuberculosis—may remain contagious for up to two weeks after you've started antibiotics. Walking pneumonia is a type of bacterial pneumonia. It comes from the bacteria named Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pneumonia is typically contagious for around 48 hours after you've started antibiotics. The incubation period is generally between one to four weeks. Someone with walking pneumonia can be contagious for a couple of weeks, even after starting treatment. While the symptoms may vary from person to person, typically those with walking pneumonia will have: You can get fungal pneumonia from breathing in fungal spores that are often found in soil and, occasionally, bird droppings.

Bacterial pneumonia is often caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, also called pneumococcal pneumonia. A case of pneumonia doesn’t necessarily require a hospital stay: If you are diagnosed with pneumonia but your symptoms aren’t severe, your doctor may direct you to manage it at home. COVID-19 aside, bacterial pneumonia can be more serious than viral pneumonia — unless you have a case of pneumonia caused by the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, often referred to as walking pneumonia, the non-medical term for atypical pneumonia.<br><a href="https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/6-things-to-know-about-pneumonia/" target="_blank">https://www.keckmedicine.org/blog/6-things-to-know-about-pneumonia/</a></li></ul></li><li id="tree-S3327440927"><strong>S3327440927:</strong> Wearing a mask does not cause bacterial pneumonia and is recommended to prevent respiratory infections during recovery from pneumonia.<ul><li id="tree-E3407998803"><strong>E3407998803:</strong> A graphic shared on social media falsely suggests that wearing a mask will cause bacterial infections and hypoxia, a condition in which the body’s cells do not receive enough oxygen.

Sociologists have played a central role in establishing the link between social relationships and health outcomes, ... For example, supportive interactions with others benefit immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular functions and reduce allostatic load, which reflects wear and tear on the body due, in part, to chronically overworked physiological systems engaged in stress responses (McEwen 1998; Seeman et al. 2002; Uchino 2004). These processes unfold over the entire life course, with effects on health. Emotionally supportive childhood environments promote healthy development of regulatory systems, including immune, metabolic, and autonomic nervous systems, as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with long-term consequences for adult health (Taylor, Repetti, and Seeman 1997). Social support refers to the emotionally sustaining qualities of relationships (e.g., a sense that one is loved, cared for, and listened to). Hundreds of studies establish that social support benefits mental and physical health (Cohen 2004; Uchino 2004). Social support may have indirect effects on health through enhanced mental health, by reducing the impact of stress, or by fostering a sense of meaning and purpose in life (Cohen 2004; Thoits 1995). A randomized experiment of the effects of support groups for women with breast cancer found that, compared to women in the control group, the physical functioning of women who participated in the peer discussion group improved if they reported low levels of emotional support from their partners at baseline, but it deteriorated if they reported initially high levels (Helgeson et al. 2000). Another psychosocial intervention tested individualized emotional and instrumental support services in an effort to improve one-year survival outcomes of adults recovering from myocardial infarction. For example, stressful family interactions may have their greatest impact on children’s health, while peer pressure and the social meaning of health habits (e.g., pressure to experiment with tobacco, alcohol, and drugs) may have their greatest impact in adolescent relationships, and social control of health habits may be most important in adult relationships.<br><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/</a></li><li id="tree-E5268899904"><strong>E5268899904:</strong> For example, supportive interactions with others benefit immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular functions and reduce allostatic load, which reflects wear and tear on the body due, in part, to chronically overworked physiological systems engaged in stress responses (McEwen 1998; Seeman et al. 2002; Uchino 2004).

Most people living with COPD experience feelings of sadness, fear and worry at times. This is common and normal when coping with a serious illness. Anxiety and depression are both more common in people living with COPD than they are in the general population. Unfortunately, they often go unrecognized and untreated by patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. Taking care of your emotional health does more than just improve your mood.

Viral and bacterial pneumonia are contagious, while others are not. Here’s how to avoid catching or spreading pneumonia. Certain bacterial strains, however—such as the bacteria that also causes tuberculosis—may remain contagious for up to two weeks after you've started antibiotics. Walking pneumonia is a type of bacterial pneumonia. It comes from the bacteria named Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pneumonia is typically contagious for around 48 hours after you've started antibiotics. The incubation period is generally between one to four weeks. Someone with walking pneumonia can be contagious for a couple of weeks, even after starting treatment. While the symptoms may vary from person to person, typically those with walking pneumonia will have: You can get fungal pneumonia from breathing in fungal spores that are often found in soil and, occasionally, bird droppings.

THE FACTS: A false post about wearing face masks has been circulating widely on Twitter after it was tweeted on June 19 by a congressional candidate in Florida. “Excessive use of face masks causes fungal and bacterial pneumonia,” wrote Jessi Melton, a conservative business owner running to represent Florida’s 22nd Congressional District. CLAIM: Wearing face masks can cause fungal and bacterial pneumonia. “The idea that contamination could cause fungal pneumonia is not a valid conclusion,” she said in a phone interview with the AP. Monroe agreed with Hamer that it’s “potentially theoretical,” but that it has not been documented. “It’s so highly unlikely with normal mask use,” Hamer explained. “There’s a real danger at spreading incorrect information like this, especially at a time when we really need to be encouraging more people to wear masks,” he added. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been other false claims about wearing masks. One that circulated widely falsely stated that wearing face masks for long periods of time could cause hypercapnia, a situation where there is too much carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.<br><a href="https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-9072351115" target="_blank">https://apnews.com/article/archive-fact-checking-9072351115</a></li><li id="tree-E9126268403"><strong>E9126268403:</strong> A graphic shared on social media falsely suggests that wearing a mask will cause bacterial infections and hypoxia, a condition in which the body’s cells do not receive enough oxygen.

Viral and bacterial pneumonia are contagious, while others are not. Here’s how to avoid catching or spreading pneumonia. Certain bacterial strains, however—such as the bacteria that also causes tuberculosis—may remain contagious for up to two weeks after you've started antibiotics. Walking pneumonia is a type of bacterial pneumonia. It comes from the bacteria named Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Bacterial pneumonia is typically contagious for around 48 hours after you've started antibiotics. The incubation period is generally between one to four weeks. Someone with walking pneumonia can be contagious for a couple of weeks, even after starting treatment. While the symptoms may vary from person to person, typically those with walking pneumonia will have: You can get fungal pneumonia from breathing in fungal spores that are often found in soil and, occasionally, bird droppings.

A provider may prescribe antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) or peramivir (Rapivab®) to reduce how long you’re sick and how sick you get from a virus. Oxygen therapy: If you’re not getting enough oxygen, a provider may give you extra oxygen through a tube in your nose or a mask on your face. Get treated for any other infections or health conditions you may have. These conditions could weaken your immune system, which could increase your chance of pneumonia. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. If you’re otherwise healthy, you can recover quickly from pneumonia when you get prompt care. However, pneumonia can be life-threatening if left untreated, especially if you have an underlying health condition. Even people who’ve been successfully treated and have fully recovered may face long-term health issues. If you don’t take all of your antibiotics, your pneumonia may come back.

CLAIM: Wearing face masks can cause fungal and bacterial pneumonia. “The idea that contamination could cause fungal pneumonia is not a valid conclusion,” she said in a phone interview with the AP. Monroe agreed with Hamer that it’s “potentially theoretical,” but that it has not been documented. “It’s so highly unlikely with normal mask use,” Hamer explained. “There’s a real danger at spreading incorrect information like this, especially at a time when we really need to be encouraging more people to wear masks,” he added.

Here are 4 things you can do if you are experiencing signs of anxiety or depression. The physical challenges of managing COPD can sometimes affect your mood and emotional health. Most people living with COPD experience feelings of sadness, fear and worry at times. This is common and normal when coping with a serious illness. Anxiety and depression are both more common in people living with COPD than they are in the general population. Unfortunately, they often go unrecognized and untreated by patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. Taking care of your emotional health does more than just improve your mood. The stress of caring for a loved one with COPD can take a toll on your own mental and emotional health. As a caregiver, it is normal to struggle at times with feelings of anger, frustration and guilt.<br><a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/living-with-copd/coping-with-emotions" target="_blank">https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/living-with-copd/coping-with-emotions</a></li><li id="tree-S1801902184"><strong>S1801902184:</strong> Individuals recovering from bacterial pneumonia should limit contact with others and may not be safe to meet friends until at least 48 hours after starting antibiotics.<ul><li id="tree-E0249418704"><strong>E0249418704:</strong> Pneumonia isn’t always contagious.

When worn by a person with an infection, masks reduce the spread of the virus to others. Masks can also protect wearers from breathing in infectious particles from people around them. Different masks offer different levels of protection. Generally, masks can help act as a filter to reduce the number of germs you breathe in or out. Their effectiveness can vary against different viruses, for example, based on the size of the virus. When worn by a person who has a virus, masks can reduce the chances they spread it to others.

THE FACTS: A false post about wearing face masks has been circulating widely on Twitter after it was tweeted on June 19 by a congressional candidate in Florida. “Excessive use of face masks causes fungal and bacterial pneumonia,” wrote Jessi Melton, a conservative business owner running to represent Florida’s 22nd Congressional District. CLAIM: Wearing face masks can cause fungal and bacterial pneumonia. “The idea that contamination could cause fungal pneumonia is not a valid conclusion,” she said in a phone interview with the AP. Monroe agreed with Hamer that it’s “potentially theoretical,” but that it has not been documented. “It’s so highly unlikely with normal mask use,” Hamer explained. “There’s a real danger at spreading incorrect information like this, especially at a time when we really need to be encouraging more people to wear masks,” he added. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been other false claims about wearing masks.

A team of global health scientists and infection preventionists at the Meedan Digital Health Lab (learnaboutcovid19.org/) told Reuters there was “no evidence” to suggest face masks can increase the chance of developing pneumonia, “or any other bacterial, fungal or viral infection in the lungs”. They added that masks are safe and effective for most people, though said there were some exceptions, such as “very young children (under two years of age in the United States) and people with health conditions that make it difficult to wear a mask (ex. “For the vast majority, wearing masks is an effective way to help reduce COVID-19 transmission without causing any major side effects, as long as masks are kept clean and used correctly,” they said.

Recovery from serious lung infections, such as pneumonia, can take longer than you expect. Learn what you can do to help your body recover, when to reach out to your healthcare provider and how to help prevent future infections. Lower respiratory infections tend to be more serious and require longer recovery. Pneumonia is the most common respiratory infection but there are many others. One thing all lower respiratory infections have in common is inflammation. Fluid buildup and cell debris in the airways can take time to clear. The symptoms you are feeling, such as cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath may linger as you heal. Signs and symptoms to watch for and report back to your healthcare provider include if your fever returns, you experience chest pain or worsening shortness of breath or if you develop any new symptoms that concern you. While you are recovering, try to limit your contact with family and friends, to help keep your germs from spreading to other people. Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia you have, how sick you are feeling, your age, and whether you have other health conditions. The goals of treatment are to cure the infection and prevent complications.

Sociologists have played a central role in establishing the link between social relationships and health outcomes, ... For example, supportive interactions with others benefit immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular functions and reduce allostatic load, which reflects wear and tear on the body due, in part, to chronically overworked physiological systems engaged in stress responses (McEwen 1998; Seeman et al. 2002; Uchino 2004). These processes unfold over the entire life course, with effects on health. Emotionally supportive childhood environments promote healthy development of regulatory systems, including immune, metabolic, and autonomic nervous systems, as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with long-term consequences for adult health (Taylor, Repetti, and Seeman 1997). Social support refers to the emotionally sustaining qualities of relationships (e.g., a sense that one is loved, cared for, and listened to). Hundreds of studies establish that social support benefits mental and physical health (Cohen 2004; Uchino 2004). Social support may have indirect effects on health through enhanced mental health, by reducing the impact of stress, or by fostering a sense of meaning and purpose in life (Cohen 2004; Thoits 1995). A randomized experiment of the effects of support groups for women with breast cancer found that, compared to women in the control group, the physical functioning of women who participated in the peer discussion group improved if they reported low levels of emotional support from their partners at baseline, but it deteriorated if they reported initially high levels (Helgeson et al. 2000). Another psychosocial intervention tested individualized emotional and instrumental support services in an effort to improve one-year survival outcomes of adults recovering from myocardial infarction. For example, stressful family interactions may have their greatest impact on children’s health, while peer pressure and the social meaning of health habits (e.g., pressure to experiment with tobacco, alcohol, and drugs) may have their greatest impact in adolescent relationships, and social control of health habits may be most important in adult relationships.<br><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/</a></li><li id="tree-E5268899904"><strong>E5268899904:</strong> For example, supportive interactions with others benefit immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular functions and reduce allostatic load, which reflects wear and tear on the body due, in part, to chronically overworked physiological systems engaged in stress responses (McEwen 1998; Seeman et al. 2002; Uchino 2004).

Minimizing Visitor Contact: For individuals at high risk of bacterial pneumonia, limiting the number of visitors and ensuring that any essential visitors wear masks can further reduce the risk of exposure to infectious agents. Pneumonia is a respiratory condition characterized by inflammation of the lungs, primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. While it can be caused by various agents, including viruses, fungi, and bacteria, bacterial pneumonia is particularly significant due to its impact on public health.

THE FACTS: A false post about wearing face masks has been circulating widely on Twitter after it was tweeted on June 19 by a congressional candidate in Florida. “Excessive use of face masks causes fungal and bacterial pneumonia,” wrote Jessi Melton, a conservative business owner running to represent Florida’s 22nd Congressional District. CLAIM: Wearing face masks can cause fungal and bacterial pneumonia. “The idea that contamination could cause fungal pneumonia is not a valid conclusion,” she said in a phone interview with the AP. Monroe agreed with Hamer that it’s “potentially theoretical,” but that it has not been documented. “It’s so highly unlikely with normal mask use,” Hamer explained. “There’s a real danger at spreading incorrect information like this, especially at a time when we really need to be encouraging more people to wear masks,” he added. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been other false claims about wearing masks.

Sociologists have played a central role in establishing the link between social relationships and health outcomes, ... For example, supportive interactions with others benefit immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular functions and reduce allostatic load, which reflects wear and tear on the body due, in part, to chronically overworked physiological systems engaged in stress responses (McEwen 1998; Seeman et al. 2002; Uchino 2004). These processes unfold over the entire life course, with effects on health. Emotionally supportive childhood environments promote healthy development of regulatory systems, including immune, metabolic, and autonomic nervous systems, as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, with long-term consequences for adult health (Taylor, Repetti, and Seeman 1997). Social support refers to the emotionally sustaining qualities of relationships (e.g., a sense that one is loved, cared for, and listened to). Hundreds of studies establish that social support benefits mental and physical health (Cohen 2004; Uchino 2004). Social support may have indirect effects on health through enhanced mental health, by reducing the impact of stress, or by fostering a sense of meaning and purpose in life (Cohen 2004; Thoits 1995). A randomized experiment of the effects of support groups for women with breast cancer found that, compared to women in the control group, the physical functioning of women who participated in the peer discussion group improved if they reported low levels of emotional support from their partners at baseline, but it deteriorated if they reported initially high levels (Helgeson et al. 2000). Another psychosocial intervention tested individualized emotional and instrumental support services in an effort to improve one-year survival outcomes of adults recovering from myocardial infarction. For example, stressful family interactions may have their greatest impact on children’s health, while peer pressure and the social meaning of health habits (e.g., pressure to experiment with tobacco, alcohol, and drugs) may have their greatest impact in adolescent relationships, and social control of health habits may be most important in adult relationships.<br><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3150158/</a></li><li id="tree-E5268899904"><strong>E5268899904:</strong> For example, supportive interactions with others benefit immune, endocrine, and cardiovascular functions and reduce allostatic load, which reflects wear and tear on the body due, in part, to chronically overworked physiological systems engaged in stress responses (McEwen 1998; Seeman et al. 2002; Uchino 2004).

Pneumonia is a respiratory condition characterized by inflammation of the lungs, primarily affecting the small air sacs known as alveoli. While it can be caused by various agents, including viruses, fungi, and bacteria, bacterial pneumonia is particularly significant due to its impact on public health.

Fluid and inflammation in your lungs makes breathing hard and causes fever and other symptoms. Antiviral medications: Viral pneumonia usually isn’t treated with medication and can go away on its own. A provider may prescribe antivirals such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu®), zanamivir (Relenza®) or peramivir (Rapivab®) to reduce how long you’re sick and how sick you get from a virus. Oxygen therapy: If you’re not getting enough oxygen, a provider may give you extra oxygen through a tube in your nose or a mask on your face. Get treated for any other infections or health conditions you may have. These conditions could weaken your immune system, which could increase your chance of pneumonia. Avoid excessive alcohol consumption. If you’re otherwise healthy, you can recover quickly from pneumonia when you get prompt care. However, pneumonia can be life-threatening if left untreated, especially if you have an underlying health condition. Even people who’ve been successfully treated and have fully recovered may face long-term health issues. If you don’t take all of your antibiotics, your pneumonia may come back. If your provider has recommended over-the-counter medicines to reduce fever (aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen), take them as directed on the label. Never give aspirin to children.
