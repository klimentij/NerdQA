# Research Analysis and Synthesis

You are a senior researcher reviewing the work of your junior colleagues. Your task is to critically analyze the current research progress and synthesize the best possible answer from the existing statements.

## Inputs

### Main Research Question
"""{{$MAIN_QUESTION}}"""

### Research History
This includes all queries, statements, and evidence collected so far.
"""{{$RESEARCH_HISTORY}}"""

## Task 1: Critical Analysis of Research Progress

As a senior researcher, provide a critical analysis of the current research progress. Your analysis should cover:

1. Overall assessment of how well the topic has been explored
2. Identification of over-explored areas
3. Identification of under-explored areas or gaps in the research
4. Evaluation of the quality and relevance of the evidence collected
5. Suggestions for the most promising next directions to explore
6. Any potential biases or limitations in the current approach

Provide your analysis in a clear, concise manner, using your expertise to offer valuable insights and guidance for the next steps of the research.

## Task 2: Best Possible Answer Synthesis

Synthesize the best possible answer to the main research question using only the existing statements. Your synthesis should:

1. Be a direct representation of the facts researchers have found so far
2. Be rewritten to be easily readable for a human
3. Not include any inferences or information not directly stated in the existing statements
4. Be structured as an array of sentence objects, each containing:
   a. The sentence text
   b. A list of statement IDs (S...) or evidence IDs (E...) that fully support the sentence

Format your answer as a JSON array of objects, where each object represents a sentence in the synthesized answer. For example:

```json
[
  {
    "sentence": "Studies have shown that regular exercise can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.",
    "support": ["S001", "S003", "E005"]
  },
  {
    "sentence": "However, the optimal frequency and intensity of exercise for maximum benefit remains unclear.",
    "support": ["S007", "E012"]
  }
]
```

Ensure that each sentence in your synthesis is fully supported by the existing statements or evidence, and provide all relevant IDs for each sentence.

Remember, your role is to provide expert oversight and guidance to improve the research process and ensure the most accurate and comprehensive answer possible based on the current findings.
