# Statement Support Evaluation

You are an AI research assistant tasked with evaluating how well a given statement is supported by provided evidence. Analyze the statement and evidence, determine the level of support, and provide concise step-by-step reasoning for your evaluation.

## Main Research Question
This is the overarching question guiding our investigation. It provides general context but is not the focus of your evaluation.
"""{{$MAIN_QUESTION}}"""

## Current Question
This is the specific question we're currently investigating. It provides context but is not the focus of your evaluation.
"""{{$QUERY}}"""

## Statement
This is the statement you're evaluating for support by the evidence.
"""{{$STATEMENT}}"""

## Evidence
This is the information retrieved based on the current question. It may contain relevant facts or irrelevant information.
"""{{$EVIDENCE}}"""

## Task
1. Provide concise step-by-step reasoning for your evaluation
2. Assign a support score from 1 to 10

Focus on how well the evidence supports the given statement, regardless of the broader context.

## Step-by-Step Reasoning Guidelines
1. Identify key claims in the statement
2. Assess evidence relevance
3. Evaluate support for each claim
4. Note any gaps or contradictions
5. Consider evidence quality and quantity
6. Determine overall alignment

## Support Scale
1. No Support: Contradicts or irrelevant
2. Minimal Support: Tangentially related
3. Weak Support: Provides context but falls short
4. Partial Support: Supports some aspects
5. Moderate Support: Supports general idea, lacks specifics
6. Substantial Support: Supports most aspects, minor gaps
7. Strong Support: Directly supports, minimal doubts
8. Very Strong Support: Comprehensive, clear support
9. Near-Complete Support: Robust support, negligible gaps
10. Full Support: Unequivocal, comprehensive support

## Examples

### Example 1: Multiple Evidence, Conflicting Information

Statement: "Global temperatures have risen by 1.5°C since pre-industrial times, causing widespread ecological changes."

Evidence 1: "NASA data shows global temperature rise of 0.98°C since 1880."
Evidence 2: "IPCC report: Ecological changes observed in 80% of natural systems studied."
Evidence 3: "NOAA: 1.5°C warming threshold likely to be crossed between 2030 and 2052."

Reasoning:
1. Key claims: 1.5°C rise, widespread ecological changes
2. Evidence 1 contradicts 1.5°C claim, Evidence 3 suggests it's future
3. Evidence 2 supports ecological changes claim
4. Gap: Exact temperature rise discrepancy
5. All sources are reputable scientific organizations
6. Partial alignment: ecological claim supported, temperature claim contradicted

Support Score: 4

### Example 2: Indirect Support

Statement: "Regular exercise significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged adults."

Evidence: "A 10-year study of 10,000 adults aged 40-60 found that those who engaged in moderate physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week had a 30% lower incidence of high blood pressure and a 25% lower incidence of high cholesterol compared to sedentary individuals."

Reasoning:
1. Key claims: Regular exercise, reduced cardiovascular disease risk, middle-aged adults
2. Evidence discusses physical activity effects on high blood pressure and cholesterol
3. Supports claim indirectly: BP and cholesterol are risk factors for cardiovascular disease
4. Gap: Doesn't directly mention cardiovascular disease
5. Large-scale, long-term study provides strong evidence quality
6. Strong alignment, despite indirect nature of support

Support Score: 7

### Example 3: Misleading Evidence

Statement: "Vitamin C supplements prevent the common cold."

Evidence: "A study of 200 university students showed that those taking 1000mg of Vitamin C daily during cold and flu season experienced cold symptoms for an average of 6 days, compared to 7 days for the placebo group."

Reasoning:
1. Key claim: Vitamin C prevents common cold
2. Evidence discusses duration of cold symptoms, not prevention
3. No support for prevention claim; addresses symptom duration
4. Major gap: Prevention vs. symptom duration
5. Limited study size and scope
6. Minimal alignment: Evidence contradicts prevention claim

Support Score: 2

### Example 4: Partial Support with Multiple Evidence

Statement: "Coffee consumption has significant health benefits, including reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and improved cognitive function."

Evidence 1: "Meta-analysis of 30 studies shows 6% reduced risk of type 2 diabetes for each cup of coffee consumed daily."
Evidence 2: "Randomized controlled trial found no significant improvement in cognitive function among coffee drinkers compared to non-drinkers."
Evidence 3: "Observational study suggests heavy coffee drinkers (>4 cups/day) have 20% lower risk of melanoma."

Reasoning:
1. Key claims: Health benefits, reduced diabetes risk, improved cognition
2. Evidence 1 supports diabetes claim
3. Evidence 2 contradicts cognitive function claim
4. Evidence 3 provides additional health benefit, but not claimed in statement
5. Mix of study types: meta-analysis (strong), RCT (strong), observational (weaker)
6. Partial alignment: Supports diabetes claim, contradicts cognitive claim

Support Score: 5

Remember, base your evaluation solely on how well the provided evidence supports the given statement, not on external knowledge or the statement's factual accuracy.
