Learn key features and benefits. Python emerges as one of the leading AI programming languages, valued for its simplicity, extensive libraries, and strong community support, making it an excellent starting point for beginners. R and Julia are highlighted for their specialized capabilities in statistical analysis and high-performance numerical computing, respectively, catering to specific needs in AI development. While traditional languages like C++ and Java retain their relevance for performance-intensive applications, emerging languages and platforms offer new possibilities, emphasizing the importance of choosing a language based on the project‚Äôs specific requirements and the developer‚Äôs expertise. Despite its roots in web development, JavaScript has emerged as a versatile player in the AI arena, thanks to an active ecosystem and powerful frameworks like TensorFlow.js. Lisp and Prolog are two of the oldest programming languages, and they were specifically designed for AI development. Lisp is known for its symbolic processing ability, which is crucial in AI for handling symbolic information effectively. It also supports procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming paradigms, making it highly flexible. Prolog, on the other hand, is a logic programming language that is ideal for solving complex AI problems. It excels in pattern matching and automatic backtracking, which are essential in AI algorithms.<br><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/best-programming-language-for-ai/" target="_blank">https://www.sitepoint.com/best-programming-language-for-ai/</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S5530943713" class="back-to-top">‚Üë Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S7195557757"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S7195557757</h3><ul><li id="tree-S7195557757"><strong>S7195557757:</strong> Learning Rust can enhance career opportunities for AI professionals due to its focus on performance and safety.<ul><li id="tree-E8279550866"><strong>E8279550866:</strong> Learning Rust offers a host of fantastic benefits for developers, including improved software safety, high performance, effortless concurrency, enhanced productivity, and abundant career opportunities.

To answer the question, we will look at the core language, its features, growth statistics, and how it fares against its competitors. Most data scientists would say that you shouldn‚Äôt learn Julia in the early stages of your data science & machine learning journey. Almost 100% of all data roles list Python or R as requirements, and choosing to learn Julia over them at the beginning of your career could be a serious mistake. These days, the required skills and tools for a data job are already so vast that it would take quite a time investment to make yourself an asset in a role. Distracting yourself with Julia could keep you away from a paid job and slow down your career. We present the distinctions between Python and Julia to help you simplify the decision-making process so you can get started on advancing or enhancing your career.

There are 3 talks that sold me on Rust being worth learning, the first is by Carol Nichols and the second is a lecture by Ryan Eberhardt and Armin Nanavari. Spoiler alert: you can get generic code if you pay the price of a Julia runtime, and that's not something Rustaceans want. If you want generics at compile time, you have to "prove" to the compiler that your types are constrained to some extent, and you relay that information by tacking on affine types to your code. That's enough of an intro, here's the table of contents. ... If for some reason you've already decided that learning Rust is a worthy endeavour, here's my list of resources to learn.

Exercism: If you want to get into some guided learning, Exercisms is great, but focuses too much on strings at the beginning for my liking.
