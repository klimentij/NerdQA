An example of this offence was calling the war an “internal civil conflict”. An advocate of the right to conscientious objection, he was accused of “justifying Russian aggression against Ukraine”. His home was searched, and he was placed under a night curfew pending trial. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church (which remained in disputed ecclesiastical subordination to the Russian Orthodox Church) was regularly accused by state authorities of remaining an agent for Russia in its war of aggression.<br><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/europe-and-central-asia/ukraine/report-ukraine/" target="_blank">https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/europe-and-central-asia/ukraine/report-ukraine/</a></li><li id="tree-E5078374554"><strong>E5078374554:</strong> MYKHAILO PURYSHEV, MARIUPOL RESIDENT ... of the war, everyone’s life changed.

MYKHAILO PURYSHEV, MARIUPOL RESIDENT AND HUMANITARIAN VOLUNTEER: “With the onset of the war, everyone’s life changed. Everything changed.”  ... This is the story of Russia’s assault on Mariupol.  · A strategic port city in southeastern Ukraine.  · These are the interviews, videos, photos, and 3D models that Human Rights Watch, SITU Research, and Truth Hounds used to reconstruct the struggles residents faced as Russian forces took over the city. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, its war against Ukraine has had a disastrous impact on civilian life, killing thousands of civilians, injuring many thousands more, and destroying civilian property and infrastructure. Russian forces committed a litany of violations of international humanitarian law, including indiscriminate and disproportionate bombing and shelling of civilian areas that hit homes and healthcare and educational facilities. Those who attempted to flee areas of fighting faced terrifying ordeals and numerous obstacles; in some cases, Russian forces forcibly transferred significant numbers of Ukrainians to Russia or Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine and subjected many to abusive security screenings. Russian forces’ countrywide, repeated attacks on Ukraine’s energy and other critical infrastructure appeared aimed at terrorizing civilians and making their life unsustainable, which is a war crime. These are the maternity and pediatric units of a hospital that Russian forces bombed on March 9.  · At least three people were killed, including a pregnant woman and her baby, who was stillborn after the attack. Seventeen people were injured. In this case, witnesses told us that there were no Ukrainian military personnel, vehicles, or installations close by at the time. A deliberate strike on a hospital not being used to carry out attacks harmful to the enemy, is a war crime.<br><a href="https://www.hrw.org/tag/russia-ukraine-war" target="_blank">https://www.hrw.org/tag/russia-ukraine-war</a></li><li id="tree-E1740717468"><strong>E1740717468:</strong> Since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, its war against Ukraine has had a disastrous impact on civilian life, killing thousands of civilians, injuring many thousands more, and destroying civilian property and infrastructure.
