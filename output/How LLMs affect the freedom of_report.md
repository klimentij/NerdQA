How LLMs affect the freedom of speech in Russia?

### Generated Statements

#### Statement 1 (ID: S9461963264)

**Statement:** The Russian government has intensified its control over online speech, leading to a significant chilling effect on freedom of expression among its citizens.

**Evidence:**
- E3822760859: This report documents Russian authorities’ stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control. Since 2012, Russian authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens of people for criminal offenses on the basis of social media posts, online videos, media articles, ...
- E4469920138: While new restrictions on freedom of expression appear to target political opposition or civic groups, they affect all Russians. Curbing free speech denies a voice to anyone dissatisfied with the ongoing economic crisis or even mildly critical of Russia’s foreign policy.
- E4814339230: The Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society, unleashed after the 2011-2012 mass protests and Vladimir Putin’s return to the presidency in May 2012. Since then, Parliament has adopted numerous laws that limit or can be used to interfere with freedom of speech and information.
- E9960261900: Such unchecked surveillance has a stifling effect on freedom of expression online. Authorities have unjustifiably prosecuted dozens on criminal charges for social media posts, online videos, media articles, and interviews. Today, many Russians are increasingly unsure about what is acceptable speech and what could land them a large fine or prison term.

**Support Score:** 0.95

**Explanation:** The evidence indicates that Russian authorities have intensified measures to control the internet and restrict freedom of expression, with unjust prosecutions for online content and a general atmosphere of fear regarding acceptable speech. This is supported by the statement that 'the Russian government’s clampdown on free speech comes as a part of a larger crackdown on civil society.'

#### Statement 2 (ID: S5569890602)

**Statement:** Legal restrictions on free speech in Russia have been increasingly justified by the government as necessary for national security, contributing to a hostile environment for dissent.

**Evidence:**
- E4602250354: Dmitry Dubrovskiy, Executive Director, Ethnic Studies Program, European University; Chair, Department of Modern Ethnography, Russian Museum of Ethnography, St. Petersburg; and Galina Starovoitova Fellow on Human Rights and Conflict Resolution, Kennan Institute
- E6777023492: Russia has a long tradition of official censorship, Dubrovskiy observed. In the tsarist era, censorship was employed by the state to defend state security in the "public interest." Restriction on free expression continued and expanded during the Soviet era. It was only in the 1980s during perestroika that restrictions on free speech began to be eased. As the country transitioned into the 1990s, freedom of speech was greater than ever before.
- E4989867344: The Russian government has the power to make such determinations, he observed, and is using that power to define speech that it does not like as "extremist." He noted that the government is successfully finding experts willing to testify in support of their claims, thereby providing a basis for these cases and in effect helping the government to restrict the freedom of speech and academic inquiry.

**Support Score:** 0.92

**Explanation:** Dmitry Dubrovskiy notes that legal restrictions on free speech in Russia have been enacted under the pretext of national security and combating extremism, which has historically been used to justify censorship. This aligns with the current environment where the government defines dissenting speech as extremist.

#### Statement 3 (ID: S2845484206)

**Statement:** In practice, freedom of speech in Russia is severely limited by government discretion and the application of vague laws, resulting in widespread self-censorship.

**Evidence:**
- E2898728916: As of 2023, Russia ranked 164 out of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders. Despite the constitution&#x27;s provision of freedom of speech, the authorities possess significant discretion to suppress any speech, organization, or activity lacking official support ...
- E8335605178: The Russian constitution provides for freedom of speech and press; however, government application of law, bureaucratic regulation, and politically motivated criminal investigations have forced the press to exercise self-censorship constraining its coverage of certain controversial issues, resulting in infringements of these rights.
- E7360330820: While there are provisions in the Russian Constitution that guarantee freedom of speech and specifically forbid censorship, the practical execution of numerous legal acts and dependence of courts results in practically unlimited control of the government over what is published and where.

**Support Score:** 0.93

**Explanation:** Despite constitutional guarantees for freedom of speech, the practical application of laws in Russia allows for significant government control over media and expression, leading to self-censorship among journalists and the public. This is evidenced by the statement that 'the authorities possess significant discretion to suppress any speech, organization, or activity lacking official support.'

#### Statement 4 (ID: S1274676004)

**Statement:** The introduction of invasive surveillance and restrictions on online speech by the Russian government has led to increased self-censorship among citizens.

**Evidence:**
- E9803982710: Russia has introduced significant restrictions to online speech and invasive surveillance of online activity and prosecutes critics under the guise of fighting extremism, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today.
- E2978855215: (Moscow) – Russia has introduced significant restrictions to online speech and invasive surveillance of online activity and prosecutes critics under the guise of fighting extremism, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The 83-page report, “Online and On All Fronts: Russia’s Assault on Freedom of Expression,” documents Russian authorities’ stepped-up measures aimed at bringing the internet under greater state control.
- E5858616059: They should not put people at risk, Human Rights Watch said. “The Russian government has been casting criticism of it as extremist, instilling fear and encouraging self-censorship,” Gorbunova said. “Today people in Russia are increasingly unsure about the boundaries of acceptable speech.”

**Support Score:** 0.94

**Explanation:** Human Rights Watch reports that the Russian government has introduced significant restrictions on online speech and invasive surveillance, which has led to increased prosecutions for online expression. This creates an environment where citizens are unsure about acceptable speech, fostering self-censorship.

#### Statement 2 (ID: S2722428241)

**Statement:** Censorship in authoritarian regimes creates an environment where dissenting views are suppressed, often justified by national security concerns.

**Evidence:**
- E6708579053: Shadmehr and Bernhardt (Reference Shadmehr and Bernhardt2015) argue that when citizens do not receive information about some state of the world, they do not know whether there was nothing to report or that information bad for the regime was censored.Footnote 11 Censorship works because people do not think about information they do not see.Footnote 12 In the extreme, there is one kind of information that is never disclosed, because it is most dangerous to the regime: information about divisions within the elite. Authoritarianism is a system in which there is only one authority that can communicate in public.
- E9678244675: As Sen observed already in Reference Sen1973 (258; emphasis added), “People may be induced by social codes of behaviour to act as if they have different preferences from what they really have.” Wedeen (Reference Wedeen1999, 82; see also Wintrobe Reference Wintrobe1998) observes, “Requiring citizens to act ‘as if’ leaves the regime in the predicament of having to evaluate popular sentiment through the prism of enforced public dissimulation.” The regime does not know how contingent is the manifest support that it receives. The question can be posed in a different language.
- S5569890602: [Previous statement S5569890602]: Legal restrictions on free speech in Russia have been increasingly justified by the government as necessary for national security, contributing to a hostile environment for dissent.

**Support Score:** 0.92

**Explanation:** The evidence indicates that censorship in authoritarian regimes leads to a lack of information about dissenting views, which is supported by the statement that legal restrictions on free speech in Russia are increasingly justified by the government as necessary for national security.

---

#### Statement 3 (ID: S3635553068)

**Statement:** The language of authoritarian regimes often emphasizes strict control and maintenance of power, which severely limits freedom of speech and encourages self-censorship.

**Evidence:**
- E1224341384: Thus, the subcategory of autocratic procedures is emphasized by a comparatively frequent usage of terms which represent a strict and uncontested maintenance of power (e.g. defense, military, monarchy). Authoritarian law and order mean, for example, that autocrats construct a discourse of danger which condemns opponents as ‘evil’ and constantly threatens them with penalty, prosecution, and prison.
- E1553764616: Several contributions assess public discourses and the language of autocrats in one or a small number of cases (March 2003; Megoran 2008; Omelicheva 2016; Maerz 2018). However, there is only little research about the rhetoric of authoritarian regimes which is based on large quantities of texts.
- S2845484206: [Previous statement S2845484206]: In practice, freedom of speech in Russia is severely limited by government discretion and the application of vague laws, resulting in widespread self-censorship.

**Support Score:** 0.93

**Explanation:** The frequent use of terms that represent strict maintenance of power in authoritarian discourse reflects the limited freedom of speech, as indicated by the statement that freedom of speech in Russia is severely limited by government discretion and vague laws.

#### Statement 4 (ID: S7743632794)

**Statement:** Invasive surveillance and restrictions on online speech in authoritarian regimes lead to increased self-censorship among citizens, as dissent is often met with coercive measures.

**Evidence:**
- E6708579053: Shadmehr and Bernhardt (Reference Shadmehr and Bernhardt2015) argue that when citizens do not receive information about some state of the world, they do not know whether there was nothing to report or that information bad for the regime was censored.Footnote 11 Censorship works because people do not think about information they do not see.Footnote 12 In the extreme, there is one kind of information that is never disclosed, because it is most dangerous to the regime: information about divisions within the elite. Authoritarianism is a system in which there is only one authority that can communicate in public.
- E2010669003: Our report, The Authoritarian Playbook: How reporters can contextualize and cover authoritarian threats as distinct from politics-as-usual outlines the seven fundamental tactics used by aspiring authoritarians, describes examples from in and outside the United States, and offers a framework journalists can use to differentiate between politics-as-usual and something more dangerous to democracy.
- S1274676004: [Previous statement S1274676004]: The introduction of invasive surveillance and restrictions on online speech by the Russian government has led to increased self-censorship among citizens.

**Support Score:** 0.94

**Explanation:** The evidence highlights that authoritarian regimes often employ coercive tactics to suppress dissent, which is consistent with the statement that invasive surveillance and restrictions on online speech lead to increased self-censorship among citizens.

**Statement:** Legal restrictions on free speech in Russia are increasingly justified by the government as necessary for national security, contributing to a hostile environment for dissent.

**Evidence:**
- E9579169163: Russia’s leadership strives for digital sovereignty with two main goals: technological independence and information control. In the face of growing conflicts with “the West” and an ongoing crisis of legitimacy at home, the regime aims to secure its stability by subjugating the IT sector.
- E3169448132: The conflict between the security interests of the Russian state on the one hand and the economic freedom required for innovation and modernization on the other is increasingly visible. The concept of digital sovereignty has been narrowed down by the regime to mean maintaining its stability by subjugating the IT sector. In recent months, Russia has introduced robust technological means for censorship and demonstrated surprisingly skillful information control on large scales.
- S5569890602: [Previous statement S5569890602]: Legal restrictions on free speech in Russia have been increasingly justified by the government as necessary for national security, contributing to a hostile environment for dissent.
