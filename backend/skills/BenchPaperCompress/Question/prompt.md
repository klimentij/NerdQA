## Task Overview
This task involves creating a precise and perfect question that the given report would answer accurately. The goal is to demonstrate how a well-crafted question can elicit a comprehensive response that synthesizes existing literature and leads to a plausible hypothesis.

## Instructions

### General Guidelines
- Create a question that would naturally lead to the given report as a response
- Ensure the question encompasses all major points covered in the report
- The question should be broad enough to allow for a synthesis of existing literature
- It should guide the respondent towards formulating a hypothesis based on prior knowledge
- The question should sound natural and realistic, like a question that a real scientist would ask if they had an advanced AI researcher as a lab assistant

### Content Focus
- The question should prompt a discussion of broad problems supported by multiple sources
- It should encourage the incorporation of existing literature
- The question should lead to a logical progression of ideas, from findings to reasoned statements
- It should culminate in a request for a plausible hypothesis

### Exclusions
- Avoid mentioning specific experiments or field studies
- Do not reference any new terms or innovations proposed in the report, that would make an answer too easy
- Focus on eliciting a synthesis of existing literature and reasoning, rather than new field studies or experiments

## Response Format

- Outline potential approaches to formulating the question

### Part 2: Question (1 paragraph)
- Write a clear, concise, and thought-provoking question that would naturally lead to the given report as a response
- Ensure the question is broad enough to cover all major points in the report
- The question should guide the respondent towards synthesizing existing literature and formulating a hypothesis
- The question should sound natural and realistic, like a question that a real scientist would ask if they had an advanced AI researcher as a lab assistant
