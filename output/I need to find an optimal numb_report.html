The influence of meal frequency and timing on health and disease has been a topic of interest for many years. While epidemiological evidence indicates an association between higher meal frequencies and lower disease risk, experimental trials have shown conflicting results. Furthermore, recent prospective research has demonstrated a significant increase in disease risk with a high meal frequency (≥6 meals/day) as compared to a low meal frequency (1–2 meals/day). Food timing that is out of sync with light/dark cues could induce higher caloric intake due to impaired satiety mechanisms through leptin and ghrelin [79]. Even other hormones involved in metabolism control are affected by circadian misalignment as thyroid hormones [80]. ... Alteration of gene expression in genes that are associated with evening eating preference and weight loss resistance e.g.,SIRT1, CLOCK 3111T/C, and Perilipin1 [81,82] The results confirmed the positive effects of consuming more calories earlier in the day, including through breakfast consumption, and the correlation between meal timing and body weight. However, it should be noted that some evidence has failed to support the importance of breakfast consumption for body weight change in free-living adults. Dhurandhar et al. [62] conducted a randomized controlled trial that assigned 309 overweight and obese adults to either eat breakfast or skip breakfast for 16 weeks. The results showed no differences during the day whilst night expenditure was significantly higher with two meals compared with six meals [34]. On the contrary, other studies demonstrated a significantly higher basal energy expenditure in the morning compared to the evening [35,36,37]. However, diurnal differences in the total energy expenditure are not consistently found in all studies [38]. Other studies suggest that weight gain and its metabolic consequences with a higher meal frequency are due to not only to the higher sugar derived energy intake [39] and associated metabolic issues, but also to increased food stimuli, hunger and desire to eat [40,41]. Thus, a regular meals pattern has potential positive effects on health outcomes regardless of meal frequency.</td>

                <td>Fitness fanatics and gurus love to debate about meal frequency, but are more or fewer meals really better for how often should you really eat to spurring muscle growth or fat loss? Find out here! Looking at studies lasting anywhere from 2-8 weeks, for both overweight individuals and individuals with a healthy BMI, it doesn't appear that the number of meals consumed per day has a significant impact on lean mass. Based on these studies, it doesn't appear that meal frequency has an effect on muscle mass. However, it should be noted that the previously mentioned studies were not done in athletes who regularly lift weights. After two weeks, there was greater muscle retention with six meals a day.[16] It should be noted here that calorie intake was only 1,200 calories a day and protein intake was only 60 grams a day (roughly 0.45 grams per pound of body weight), both of which are far lower than most males who are dieting with the goal of muscle retention. However, can increasing the number of times you eat each day really speed up your metabolic rate and help with weight loss? When consuming the same total calories split between two versus six meals, one versus three versus five meals, or two versus 3-5 meals, there was no difference in metabolic rate in overweight or obese individuals. When consuming the same total calories split between two versus six meals, one versus three versus five meals, or two versus 3-5 meals, there was no difference in metabolic rate in overweight or obese individuals.[1-2] Furthermore, no difference in metabolic rate was seen between consuming 2 or 7 meals daily in participants of a healthy weight.[4]</td>

Out of the five studies conducted in field settings, three used a randomized crossover design (22, 31–34). For the 5 studies, the number of eating occasions in the EF manipulations varied greatly, ranging from 1 to 12 eating occasions per day, intervention length ranged from 1 to 8.5 weeks, and sample size per condition ranged from 4 to 15 participants (22, 31–34). 34.

One dietary strategy that has long been proposed in the lay literature to improve appetite control and assist with weight management is increased eating frequency (EF) (i.e., eat small amounts of food every 2–3 h – “grazing”) (8, 9). However, while “grazing” is often suggested as a helpful strategy for managing hunger, the Dietary Guidelines Committee of 2010 stated that there is a lack of research in the area on EF and body weight and obesity, thus conclusions regarding an optimum EF prescription for weight management cannot be made and research on this topic is greatly needed (10). Therefore, within the scientific community there is agreement that the relationship between EF and management of food intake and weight is not clear (10).</td>

Examples of such prescriptions include fasting or caloric restriction (e.g., 500 calories) on alternate days or 2 d each week, or forgoing breakfast and lunch several days each week (Fig. 3). The available evidence suggests that patients may be able to comply with such diets when there is rigorous follow-up (44, 45, 47), and it will be important to determine if compliance would increase further if patients were able to choose an eating pattern-based prescription that best fits their weekly routines. Recent findings suggest that it may be possible for many people to adopt a long-term change in their lifestyle from eating three meals plus snacks every day to an IER diet if they are able to keep on the new eating pattern during a transition period of approximately 1 mo (45). Thus, far, relatively few RCTs of IER and TRF have been performed in human subjects, with the results of several studies of alternate-day and twice weekly energy restriction demonstrating weight loss and abdominal fat reduction and suggesting improvements in indicators of energy and lipid metabolism and inflammation (44–46, 51, 61). On the other hand, a study of TRF in which healthy normal weight subjects consumed a balanced daily food intake within a 4-h or 12-h time period each day revealed no improvement (79, 80), which is similar to the lack of any short-term benefit of TRF in mice when the animals are fed a balanced diet (23). Unfortunately, the common knowledge that reducing overall calorie intake and regular exercise can help optimize body weight and reduce disease risk has, in many cases, not been implemented successfully. Some of the advice provided by physicians and dieticians to their patients is consistent with the current scientific evidence, including the benefits of vegetables, fruits, fiber, nuts, and fish, and the value of reducing or eliminating snacks. Humans are highly heterogeneous with regard to their genetic composition, epigenetic landscape, and the environmental factors to which they are exposed throughout life. It is therefore likely that there will be considerable variability among human subjects in the responses of their cells and organ systems (and overall health) to different eating patterns. Although there is sufficient evidence to suggest that CR and IER can improve health indicators in most or all obese human subjects (2), data are lacking with regard to normal weight subjects.</td>

In these experiments, animals in the ad lib diet have unrestricted access to food, not only in quantity but also in frequency, whilst the CR group can only eat within a specific window, usually determined by the researcher’s schedule. In these settings, meals are often spaced out, creating prolonged fasting windows that could influence the outcomes [94]. This is an important issue because fasting is a different approach than traditional CR. In a 1989 paper, authors compared a very high frequency of meals (17) to a lower frequency (3) and found an improvement of total and LDL cholesterol with the higher frequency; however, this particular approach is clearly atypical in ordinary life [12]. A recent study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) project showed a lower concentration of total and LDL cholesterol in subjects reporting a higher (≥6 times/day) meal frequency compared to those who ate 1 or 2 times a day, even when adjusted for age, BMI, physical activity, smoking, total energy intake, and macron We now know that insulin activates a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMGCoA) reductase (the target for statins) [45].

It was demonstrated that a higher meal frequency (nibbling) reduced insulin concentrations as compared to three meals daily [12], likely caused by a reduction in cholesterol synthesis [29].</td>

In a large, cross-sectional study conducted within the Norfolk cohort of EPIC (European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer; n=14 666; age, 45–75 years), greater frequency of eating was associated with lower mean concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol.79 Individuals who reported eating ≥6 times a day had mean total cholesterol levels that were ≈0.15 mmol/L lower than in individuals who ate 1 or 2 times a day, independently of TEI, age, BMI, smoking, physical activity, and nutrients. Eating frequency was not associated with HDL cholesterol. Among men, infrequent meal frequency was associated with greater risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus over 16 years of follow-up.61 Compared with men who ate 3 meals a day, men who ate 1 to 2 times a day had an HR for diabetes mellitus of 1.26 (95% CI, 1.09–1.46) after adjustment for age, lifestyle, diet, and other potential confounders. The authors concluded that the improvement in IR in the group consuming a large breakfast implies an eating schedule that is synchronized with the circadian pacemaker but that consuming a larger dinner does not worsen IR in these women. This beneficial effect of a larger breakfast on the cardiometabolic risk profile is not universally observed, however.

Although major research efforts have focused on how specific components of foodstuffs affect health, relatively little is known about a more fundamental aspect of diet, the frequency and circadian timing of meals, and potential benefits of intermittent periods with no or very low energy intakes. During night-shift work the individuals are subject to both prolonged hours of artificial lighting and an abnormal eating schedule. Furthermore, during the weekend the tendency to maintain a day-active social life imposes a jet-lag–type paradigm in which both central and peripheral clocks attempt to adjust to a weekend lifestyle. Understanding the mechanism of TRF will help to predict whether a certain eating pattern is beneficial or whether individuals with specific genotype are predisposed to erratic eating patterns. Missense mutation in circadian clock component Per1 has been shown to affect eating patterns in mice (21). However, the presence of intact food anticipatory activity in SCN ablated rodents or those lacking functional circadian oscillator genes points to yet-unidentified genes and circuits in eating-pattern determination (82, 83). Not only does circadian phase influence the metabolic response to food intake, food intake itself has recently been demonstrated to be under control by the endogenous circadian system, independent of the sleep/wake and fasting/feeding cycle (32), possibly helping explain why breakfast is often the smallest meal of the day or even skipped all together. Compared with those fed ad libitum, the lifespans of organisms from yeast and worms, to mice and monkeys can be extended by dietary energy restriction (33–35). Data collected from individuals practicing severe dietary restriction indicate that humans undergo many of the same molecular, metabolic, and physiologic adaptations typical of long-lived CR rodents (36).</td>

This can include all or one of your daily meals. There are many benefits that come along with meal planning such as eating more nutritious meals while saving time, energy and money. If you do not have time in the morning, try preparing the food the night before, like rice and chicken, to reheat the next day to make a quick, healthy meal. Planning ahead can also incorporate the same food into multiple meals by utilizing leftovers (using leftover meat in a soup for example). Time is saved by having a specific grocery list, cutting out the aimless wandering through aisles. Aimless wandering can lead to a cart full of unessential odds and ends which can cost you greatly at the check-out, meal planning helps eliminate this. The meals that are prepared at home are often more nutritious than ones that might be consumed in a restaurant, adding another positive to meal planning.</td>

This study aimed to design an artificial intelligence (AI)–powered meal planner that can generate personalized healthy meal plans based on the user’s specific health conditions, personal preferences, and status. We proposed a system that integrates semantic reasoning, fuzzy logic, heuristic search, and multicriteria analysis to produce flexible, optimized meal plans based on the user’s health concerns, nutrition needs, as well as food restrictions or constraints, along with other personal preferences. We implemented a mobile app prototype system and evaluated its effectiveness through a use case study and user study.
