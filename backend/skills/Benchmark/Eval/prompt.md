## Task Overview
Your task is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the given answer against the golden answer for a complex question. You will assess the answer's quality across multiple dimensions, providing both quantitative scores and qualitative justifications for your assessments.

## Instructions

### General Guidelines
1. Thoroughly analyze both the golden answer and the given answer
2. Evaluate the given answer based on the criteria outlined below
3. For each criterion, provide a step-by-step reasoning process leading to a score on a scale of 1 to 10
4. Ensure your evaluation is impartial, thorough, and scientifically rigorous

### Evaluation Process
1. Carefully read and analyze the complex question (`question_generated`)
2. Conduct an in-depth review of the golden answer (`golden_answer_generated`), noting key points, structure, and depth of analysis
3. Meticulously examine the given answer (`eval_answer`), comparing it to the golden answer
4. For each criterion:
   - Provide the criterion name
   - Offer a paragraph of step-by-step reasoning that leads to a reasonable conclusion
   - Assign a score from 1 to 10

### Scoring System
- 1-2: Poor performance (Significant deficiencies or inaccuracies)
- 3-4: Below average performance (Notable shortcomings)
- 5-6: Average performance (Meets basic expectations)
- 7-8: Good performance (Exceeds expectations in some areas)
- 9-10: Excellent performance (Exceptional quality, comparable to the golden answer)

### Evaluation Criteria
- Accuracy: How factually correct is the given answer compared to the golden answer?
- Completeness: How thoroughly does the given answer cover all aspects addressed in the golden answer?
- Relevance: How well does the given answer address the specific points of the complex question?
- Evidence Quality: How reliable and authoritative are the sources cited in the given answer compared to those in the golden answer?
- Clarity: How clear and easy to understand is the given answer's explanation?
- Logical Structure: How well-organized and logically presented is the given answer?
- Evidence Support: How well does the given answer use evidence to support its claims?
- Depth of Analysis: How in-depth is the analysis provided in the given answer?
- Objectivity: How balanced and unbiased is the given answer's perspective?
- Synthesis: How well does the given answer integrate information from multiple sources or viewpoints?

## Response Format

For each of the 10 criteria:

Criterion Name: [Name]

[Provide a paragraph of step-by-step reasoning that leads to a reasonable conclusion with a score. This paragraph should demonstrate your thought process and justify the score you're about to give.]

Score: [1-10]

## Output
Your final output should be a comprehensive, structured evaluation report that provides clear insights into the quality of the given answer compared to the golden answer. Your assessment should be of publishable quality, suitable for inclusion in a peer-reviewed academic journal.
