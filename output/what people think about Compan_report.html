Far from the notion that "privacy is dead," research into privacy perceptions has consistently demonstrated "consumers fundamentally care about privacy and often act on that concern." Consumers globally are worried about the ubiquity of data collection and new uses of data by emerging technologies, including AI. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 81% of consumers think the information collected by AI companies will be used in ways people are uncomfortable with, as well as in ways that were not originally intended. Another study in January 2024 by KPMG found 63% of consumers were concerned about the potential for generative AI to compromise an individual's privacy by exposing personal data to breaches or through other forms of unauthorized access or misuse. Thus, consumer perceptions of AI are being shaped by their feelings about how these emerging technologies will affect their privacy. The following sections examine how consumer privacy perceptions regarding the use of AI varies across consumer-centric contexts and domains. ... While general trust in AI remains high, several recent studies on consumer reception of AI tools found their acceptance to be strongly tied to the industry and/or the type of data involved. For example, a 2023 Pew Research study revealed people were more or less split on the acceptability of social media companies using AI to analyze what people do on their sites and deliver personalized content, or for smart speakers using AI to assist in the recognition of the speaker's identity. But when done by hundreds or thousands of companies, the harm adds up. Moreover, these small harms are dispersed among millions (and sometimes billions) of people. Over time, as people are each inundated by a swarm of small harms, the overall societal impact is significant." Thus, decades of privacy harm from all sides — from cybercriminals to government surveillance programs to data-hungry private actors — have decreased the public's trust in the collection and processing of personal data.<br><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/" target="_blank">https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/</a></li><li id="tree-E6347686820"><strong>E6347686820:</strong> This resource analyzes how consumer perspectives of AI are shaped by the way emerging technologies affect their privacy.<br><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/" target="_blank">https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S2685057848" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S2756949750"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S2756949750</h3><ul><li id="tree-S2756949750"><strong>S2756949750:</strong> Consumer trust in AI companies is significantly diminished due to widespread concerns about data collection practices and privacy violations.<ul><li id="tree-E6347686820"><strong>E6347686820:</strong> This resource analyzes how consumer perspectives of AI are shaped by the way emerging technologies affect their privacy.<br><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/" target="_blank">https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/</a></li><li id="tree-E7479071828"><strong>E7479071828:</strong> Being cognizant of consumer perspectives on privacy and AI, therefore, is of key importance across both the public and the private sector. ...

Far from the notion that "privacy is dead," research into privacy perceptions has consistently demonstrated "consumers fundamentally care about privacy and often act on that concern." Consumers globally are worried about the ubiquity of data collection and new uses of data by emerging technologies, including AI. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 81% of consumers think the information collected by AI companies will be used in ways people are uncomfortable with, as well as in ways that were not originally intended. Another study in January 2024 by KPMG found 63% of consumers were concerned about the potential for generative AI to compromise an individual's privacy by exposing personal data to breaches or through other forms of unauthorized access or misuse. Thus, consumer perceptions of AI are being shaped by their feelings about how these emerging technologies will affect their privacy. The following sections examine how consumer privacy perceptions regarding the use of AI varies across consumer-centric contexts and domains. ... While general trust in AI remains high, several recent studies on consumer reception of AI tools found their acceptance to be strongly tied to the industry and/or the type of data involved. For example, a 2023 Pew Research study revealed people were more or less split on the acceptability of social media companies using AI to analyze what people do on their sites and deliver personalized content, or for smart speakers using AI to assist in the recognition of the speaker's identity. But when done by hundreds or thousands of companies, the harm adds up. Moreover, these small harms are dispersed among millions (and sometimes billions) of people. Over time, as people are each inundated by a swarm of small harms, the overall societal impact is significant." Thus, decades of privacy harm from all sides — from cybercriminals to government surveillance programs to data-hungry private actors — have decreased the public's trust in the collection and processing of personal data.<br><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/" target="_blank">https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/</a></li><li id="tree-E6347686820"><strong>E6347686820:</strong> This resource analyzes how consumer perspectives of AI are shaped by the way emerging technologies affect their privacy.<br><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/" target="_blank">https://iapp.org/resources/article/consumer-perspectives-of-privacy-and-ai/</a></li></ul></li></ul><a href="#cite-S8675918716" class="back-to-top">↑ Back to citation</a></div><div class="citation-tree" id="tree-S8404125939"><h3>Citation Tree for Statement S8404125939</h3><ul><li id="tree-S8404125939"><strong>S8404125939:</strong> User trust in AI-enabled systems is significantly influenced by socio-ethical considerations, technical features, and user characteristics, highlighting the importance of user involvement in the development process.<ul><li id="tree-E7483096391"><strong>E7483096391:</strong> User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems has been increasingly recognized and proven as a key element to fostering adoption.

User trust in Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled systems has been increasingly recognized and proven as a key element to fostering adoption. It has been suggested that AI-enabled systems must go beyond technical-centric approaches and towards embracing a more human centric approach, a core principle of the human-computer interaction (HCI) field. Selecting the most appropriate trust definition to depict user trust in a specific context should be the focus instead of comparing definitions. User trust in AI-enabled systems is found to be influenced by three main themes, namely socio-ethical considerations, technical and design features, and user characteristics. User characteristics dominate the findings, reinforcing the importance of user involvement from development through to monitoring of AI enabled systems. In conclusion, user trust needs to be addressed directly in every context where AI-enabled systems are being used or discussed.

The study of human-machine systems is central to a variety of behavioral and engineering disciplines, including management science, human factors, robotics, and human-computer interaction. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have brought the study of human-AI teams into sharper focus. An important set of questions for those designing human-AI interfaces concerns trust, transparency, and error tolerance. An important set of questions for those designing HAI interfaces concerns trust—specifically, human trust in the AI systems with which they form teams. We review the literature on how perceiving an AI making mistakes violates trust and how such violations might be repaired. Just as human collaboration would be impossible without some degree of trust between team members, some form of trust in algorithmic systems is necessary for HAI teams to perform smoothly and effectively. It follows too that if trust is ever violated, its repair will be crucial in any attempt to rehabilitate team performance. Here, we briefly review the literature on how perceiving an AI make mistakes violates trust and how such violations might be repaired. Both aversion and its opposite, appreciation, are inappropriate attitudes toward systems that are generally trustworthy in this sense.4,14 · Human-AI (HAI) team researchers hail from a variety of behavioral and engineering disciplines, including management science, human factors, robotics, and human-computer interaction.<br><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9023880/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9023880/</a></li><li id="tree-E2523548410"><strong>E2523548410:</strong> When employees perceive biased or unfair outcomes resulting from AI decision-making, their trust in the technology further erodes. Employees often struggle to understand how AI systems function and make decisions. This lack of transparency can generate unease, suspicion and even fear. In addition, when employees perceive biased or unfair outcomes resulting from AI decision-making, their trust in the technology further erodes. When employees can access information about data, AI training and AI algorithm logic, they can collaborate effectively with AI systems. This gives HR staff involved in the hiring process valuable insights into how AI systems make decisions. That leads to increased confidence in making informed hiring choices. In other areas of the organization, AI-powered features like real-time analytics and performance dashboards allow frontline employees and supervisors to understand how their actions are being evaluated. That, in turn, make them more likely to trust the data-driven decisions from AI. This enables them to deliver personalized and tailored experiences, ultimately building trust between employees and AI systems. ... Communicate the purpose of using AI-driven decision-making, how it works and what safeguards are in place to ensure accuracy. Work to balance explainability and confidentiality in AI algorithms, prioritizing the need to safeguard proprietary information and sensitive data. By creating a culture of transparency and trust around AI-driven decision-making, companies can help employees feel safe and respected. In addition to building morale, this will lead to more productive and successful workplaces as well as better overall outcomes for the organization.

The study of human-machine systems is central to a variety of behavioral and engineering disciplines, including management science, human factors, robotics, and human-computer interaction. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning have brought the study of human-AI teams into sharper focus. An important set of questions for those designing human-AI interfaces concerns trust, transparency, and error tolerance. An important set of questions for those designing HAI interfaces concerns trust—specifically, human trust in the AI systems with which they form teams. We review the literature on how perceiving an AI making mistakes violates trust and how such violations might be repaired. Just as human collaboration would be impossible without some degree of trust between team members, some form of trust in algorithmic systems is necessary for HAI teams to perform smoothly and effectively. It follows too that if trust is ever violated, its repair will be crucial in any attempt to rehabilitate team performance.
